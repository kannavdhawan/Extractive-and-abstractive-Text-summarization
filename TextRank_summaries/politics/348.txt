tv debate urged for party chiefs broadcasters should fix a date for a pre election televised debate between the three main political leaders, according to the hansard society.chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter of public interest .if mr blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, lord holme said.what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no one has heard directly from the prime minister, he said.lord holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements .lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called.the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001.tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign.
