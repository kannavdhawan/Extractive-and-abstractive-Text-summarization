act on detention ruling, uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, mary robinson has said.mrs robinson said the law lords' ruling was in line with international legal opinion and praised their very decisive eight to one majority.mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg.if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords.the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us.the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status .
