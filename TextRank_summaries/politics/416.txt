top tories on lib dem 'hit list' the liberal democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top tories including leader michael howard at the next general election.others targeted include oliver letwin, david davis and theresa may, lib dem's elections chief lord rennard said.he said it was nothing personal but that very many of the prominent conservatives had slender leads in seats where the lib dems were second.in 2001, michael howard won the folkestone hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the liberal democrat candidate peter carroll, giving the tory leader a majority of 5,907.i just don't think labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a conservative.
