drink remark 'acts as diversion' the first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk once in a while has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.jack law, chief executive of alcohol focus scotland, said jack mcconnell's comment was ill advised .the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland's binge drinking problems, mr law said.mr mcconnell was speaking on monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.the one sentence comment was immediately criticised by the scottish national party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk.but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were a recognition that people will get drunk .mr macdonell, political editor of the scotsman, said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister.mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking.he said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink.he told ms sturgeon it is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that i 'should encourage young people to get drunk'.
