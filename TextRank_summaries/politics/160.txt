lawyer attacks anti terror laws a senior barrister who has resigned in protest over the government's anti terror laws says the current system is giving britain a bad name.ian macdonald qc quit when the government failed to recognise a house of lords ruling that detaining terror suspects indefinitely is unlawful.mr macdonald told bbc news the reason why i am resigning is because i fundamentally disagree with locking people up without any trial for an indefinite period on reasonable suspicion.under the anti terrorism, crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial.but mr macdonald believes that detainees currently being held should be entitled to a trial by jury.they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects.mr macdonald said he had no idea whether further resignations would follow.they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.
