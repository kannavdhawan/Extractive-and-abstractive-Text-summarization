mps tout lords replacement plan a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.the cross party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected.the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords.but the all party group, including tories ken clarke and sir george young, labour's robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a large majority .the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely elected second chamber.their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament, and its members would be known as mscps.what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable.it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a largely democratic second chamber in their manifestos.the problem, i think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him, he said.the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate.
