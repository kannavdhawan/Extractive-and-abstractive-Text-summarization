damian hockney, now veritas deputy leader, and peter hulme cross were elected in 2004 on the list system.mr hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats.we would however like you to be given an opportunity to reflect on what you have done, to restore your own credibility with the electorate and return the seats to the party which won them fair and square at the last election.mr hockney said the law worked in exactly the same way for the gla as it did for other electoral list systems.the greater london act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.
