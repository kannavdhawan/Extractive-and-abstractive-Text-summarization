labour's core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he's back and still hungry for the job of prime minister but does that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members, is the dry assessment of graham lane, leader of the labour group on newham council.the problem, according to mr lane, is not continuing divisions over iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but mr blair himself.his friend, saxon spence, leader of devon county labour group, lays the blame for any lack of campaigning zeal on one issue above all others.but the two friends were fired up by gordon brown's speech on saturday, with its appeal to core labour values on social justice, health and education.i think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place, said mrs spence.katrina bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout.a party of councillors from nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with mr blair's leadership and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever.it might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and i think that is the greater problem than iraq, said nottingham city councillor brian parbutt.and even mr blair's most vocal critics seemed to agree on one thing he is a master of the sort of glossy, high profile campaigning that has become labour's hallmark, epitomised by friday's whistle stop tour of marginal seats.a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at mr blair's failure to, as they saw it, shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east.and they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the labour message come election time.if you are not fired up about the election, then what's the point there is no complacency as far as i can see in the labour party.mr telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked what has labour done for the north east i have had doors slammed in my face, he said.every activist i spoke to said they were proud of what they believed labour had achieved in their local communities the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people.the problem they faced, they said, was converting this local feelgood factor into votes.
