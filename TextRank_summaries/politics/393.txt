until 1857, the only way in england to get a full divorce which allowed re marriage was to obtain an act of parliament by proving adultery or life threatening cruelty.the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament's victoria tower.divorce by parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses.among the records is the story of jane campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband.as well as making divorce history, jane campbell won custody of her children unusual for a woman at the time.but divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and parliament.there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament, including composer george frideric handel in 1727.and the mass of private bills which, for example authorise the building of railways and roads, contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them.this wealth of material has long been open to the public at the house of lords record office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room.david prior, assistant clerk of the archives, says the catalogue opens up new possibilities for research.the archives do, of course, hold records of high and low politics too for both houses of parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk.records for the commons only date back to 1834 anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834.
