documents released after 30 years reveal the failed negotiations by the then prime minister following the dramatic february general election.liberal leader jeremy thorpe appeared willing to form a coalition government.but it partly collapsed over the conservative leader's own role, prompting the queen to ask harold wilson to form a labour government.he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives.according to the documents released at the national archives, the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal.hours later sir edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe's colleagues refused to support him.the pm said he was bound to tell mr thorpe that his colleagues had told him that they would not agree to serve under any other prime minister.documents show that sir edward mulled over resigning and perhaps returning to coalition government in a labour led coalition.but he already knew mr wilson would not form a coalition with either the liberals or the conservatives because of the opposition of the labour left.within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe, sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government.
