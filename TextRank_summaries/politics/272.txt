but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the tories, who are now the real threat to labour.as tory leader michael howard kicked off his election campaign, the lib dem leader charles kennedy dismissed the conservatives as a fading force.he would make no predictions other than that he expected the lib dems to increase both their votes and their commons seats at the election.on the war on iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.he was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to prop up either of the other big parties after the election.the other parties will still insist that the lib dems are no hopers whose greatest effect on the poll will be to boost the hopes of their opponents by denying them otherwise winnable seats.they would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power.but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.
