profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record breaking ninth budget, gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time.his early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party.his first attempt to enter westminster, for edinburgh south in 1979, was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs, michael ancram.entering westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield, tony blair.after the death of leader john smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington.the other part of the deal, that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of westminster legend.but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, mr brown continued his devotion to politics.a year later, in october 2003, the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side.the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution.mr blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute.but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labour's campaign.amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader.and mr blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime minister's intention to serve a full third term if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.
