mr begg's father, azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was a hero .the men are being held at london's paddington green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by uk anti terror officers.but louise christian, the lawyer representing mr abbasi and mr mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station.before being driven by police from birmingham to london, azmat begg said he was concerned for his son moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug.as azmat begg arrived at the london police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements.police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the uk.but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said evidence obtained by mi5 while the four were in cuba was absolutely inadmissible in uk courts.in an interview with the independent, sir john said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the uk.louise christian said that after being tortured and abused at guantanamo bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate.
