in a written statement, constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an mp would be reduced to 18.the government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age, said mr leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24.the announcement from mr leslie who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe tory seat prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16.the votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective.that is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place.the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.
