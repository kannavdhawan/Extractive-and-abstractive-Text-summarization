it will be should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006.if we reject this treaty, britain will be isolated and weak in europe, said foreign secretary jack straw, who along with the rest of the cabinet, will back a yes vote.but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as two separate issues .this is tony blair's cheap gesture to the pro constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win.neil o'brien, director of anti constitution group vote no, said the reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.the uk independence party said if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu.he told bbc radio 4's today programme the sooner we get on with this, the better.mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum.jack straw, who argues the constitution reflected a british vision for europe and gives national governments a stronger grip , has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006.
