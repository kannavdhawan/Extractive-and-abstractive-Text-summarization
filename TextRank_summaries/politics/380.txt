minimum wage increased to 5.05 the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage challenging .we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact, said chairman adair turner.the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a symbol of decency and fairness .for too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard working families, he said.the government has not accepted the commission's recommendation that 21 year olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on.the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.a 3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17 year olds, but apprentices are exempt.the trade unions congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a 6 minimum wage by next year.but the confederation of british industry cbi called for a pause year to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october.what employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not seek to disturb the increase.it's still not good enough i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni.this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 21 year olds got a fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them would you be happy to work for less than 5.05 an hour .i can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either.they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses we all remember michael howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced funny how he's gone quiet on that one jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in.i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and 5.05 is hardly a fortune.if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour.hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services domestic, catering portering etc pay the minimum wage of 4.85 as the basic rate.how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow this is definitely the right step in the right direction.good strategy isn't it although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.by increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.the extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting up business in the uk, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere.i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers.this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage.how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies.we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.if the rate rises to 6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential.the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs.i know about this great idea don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage.i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don't believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.i worked hard, went to college part time, got my a levels and degree bettered myself.a minimum wage just makes people complacent.i might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.in my day type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day' 20 years ago as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get.i have my gcse's a levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it.as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional 5000 per year.on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well.if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the 6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt namely mine.think of us employers as well mr blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement it is good news for many asians living in uk.blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.
