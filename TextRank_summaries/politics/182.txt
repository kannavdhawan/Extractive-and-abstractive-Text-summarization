anti terror plan faces first test plans to allow home secretary charles clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in parliament.the two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say so of the home secretary, rather than a judge.tory shadow home secretary david davis warned of the potential for miscarriages of justice, like the guildford four for which tony blair recently apologised as a result of the pressure on politicians to lock up terror suspects.mr clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now even for the 11 current terror detainees.the new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the law lords' concerns, would apply to british as well as foreign terror suspects.opposition mps are also angry they will have only two days wednesday and next monday to debate the new plans before they pass to the house of lords.in a rare move, the tories and lib dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are excessive .it argues decisions should be taken on a higher standard of proof and the plan wrongly infringes the right to liberty by failing to bring terrorists to trial where there is evidence.he questioned why there was such a rush to introduce the legislation when mr clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away.liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said we believe it should be the judge that takes decisions, not politicians.
