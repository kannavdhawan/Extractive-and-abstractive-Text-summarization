the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.the report, which followed a year long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group .many of those who ended up taking their own lives had presented themselves to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said.yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives.the misplaced over reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered.the committee also highlighted deeply worrying cases of children and young people taking their own lives.between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres.it picked out the case of joseph scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry.
