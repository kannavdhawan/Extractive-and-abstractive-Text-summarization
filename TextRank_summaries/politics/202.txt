tories opposing 24 hour drinking the tories say plans to extend pub opening times should be put on hold until binge drinking is under control, despite backing a law change last year.earlier chief constable green questioned how his officers would be able to practically apply powers allowing them to shut down problem premises.he warned that if drinking establishments were allowed to open until three or four in the morning the police would have to take officers off day shifts in order to do their job effectively at night.earlier this year the royal college of physicians said it opposed the plan to extend drinking hours when there was already an epidemic of binge drinking.minister richard caborn said the government was tackling the causes and the symptoms of the problem by allowing more powers to close down problem premises.the law abiding majority who want the ability, after going to the cinema or theatre say, to have a drink at the time they want should not be inconvenienced, we shouldn't have to have restrictions that no other city in europe has, just in order to do something for that tiny minority who abuse alcohol, who go out and fight and cause disturbances.
