straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union's arms embargo on china, despite opposition from the us and japan.mr straw, visiting beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to china, burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons.the result of any decision to lift the arms embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china, either in quantitative or qualitative terms, mr straw said.he said mr straw was naive beyond belief if he accepted china's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan.brad adams, from the uk's human rights watch, said this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square.but mr straw insisted the eu's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.
