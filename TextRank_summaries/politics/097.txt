home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached.mr clarke told the times i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come.however, he added i do not think the solution to the law lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help.but the liberal democrat's shadow home secretary, mark oaten, accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country.the bbc's home affairs correspondent, daniel sandford, said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, david blunkett.but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult.the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial, he said.
