a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us.an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi, the men's solicitor says.the letter, from the home office, says i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the united kingdom, you would take part in activities against the united kingdom, or allied targets.the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative.amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on torture evidence obtained at guantanamo bay.furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay, said director kate allen.the men's solicitor, louise christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture.
