that charge was denied by mr mandelson, who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell's campaigning skills.mr mandelson, a former labour communications director, told bbc radio 4's today programme i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills.i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign.mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning.conservative co chairman liam fox said mr campbell's return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard recently withdrawn from the party's website were a sign of abusive politics .labour peer baroness kennedy, who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks.
