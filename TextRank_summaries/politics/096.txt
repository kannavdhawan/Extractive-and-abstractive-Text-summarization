tories 'would cut number of mps' the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one fifth if they were elected, tory leader michael howard has said.mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly.if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps.mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england.the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped.
