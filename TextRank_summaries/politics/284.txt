kennedy's cautious optimism charles kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.but doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached, including by conservatives, that the conservatives are not going to win this election.this is really going to be the first modern three party uk election that we have all experienced .won't voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that, geographically, the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain.mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters.he insists his three headline commitments, to be financed from a 1% tax increase on those earning over 100,000 a year, will appeal right across the political spectrum.he also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to old labour.i think the tax argument has moved on a lot in british politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election, he said.under a labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.we are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies .
