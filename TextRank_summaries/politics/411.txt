howard's unfinished business he's not finished yet, whispered the conservative party person as your reporter attempted to slip quietly from the hall.michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain's description of him as an attack mongrel , claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge.the speech, which was peppered with references to mr howard's humble beginnings as the child of immigrants , had been introduced by his son nick, a trainee vicar, who praised his father's honesty.but mr howard's overall message that the tories have labour on the run and that they can win the next election did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago.mr howard claimed, with some justification, that the tories' campaign has got off to a great start .they have had labour on the back foot over immigration, with tony blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional labour territory such as health and education.their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline, cleaner hospitals i mean, how hard is it to keep a hospital clean and immigration it's not racist to impose limits on immigration under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this, they say, contrasts with labour's negative campaigning, such as its now infamous flying pigs poster.the peter hain mongrel attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong a by product, he claims, of the tories setting the agenda.a few weeks of positive headlines have also done wonders for tory activists' morale likely to be a crucial factor at an election which, most analysts seem to agree, will hinge on which party can get their core support out.some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when ted heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from harold wilson's labour party.much of the credit for the tories' recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby, the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no hoper john howard, of australia's liberal party, into a serial election winner.the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10.even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead.but as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his australian namesake, mr howard really isn't finished yet.
