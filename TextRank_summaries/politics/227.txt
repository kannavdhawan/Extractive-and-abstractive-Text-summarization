tory leader michael howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards.mr clarke, writing in the times, accused some critics of liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears by claiming id cards would erode civil liberties.mr clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail.he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim.ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime.he told bbc's breakfast with frost programme that mr clarke had a real opportunity on monday following the departure of mr blunkett.if you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the identity cards bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the new year that is the sensible way to go about it but i think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all.
