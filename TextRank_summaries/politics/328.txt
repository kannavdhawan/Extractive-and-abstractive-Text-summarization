goldsmith 'i was not leant on' the attorney general has again denied being leant on by downing street to make the legal case for invading iraq.lord goldsmith said the answer represented his genuinely held independent view the war was legal.in the house of lords, the attorney general faced a call by former tory lord chancellor lord mackay to now publish the full text of the advice the suggestion was rejected.another peer meanwhile, lord skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction .the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.tony blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion.on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, tory mp michael mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry, told the bbc that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule.a book published by philippe sands qc, a member of cherie blair's matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.a short statement about lord goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 just before a crucial commons vote on the military action did not suggest this.
