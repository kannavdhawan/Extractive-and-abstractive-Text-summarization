terror powers expose 'tyranny' the lord chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and british terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.lord falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.but thriller writer frederick forsyth tells bbc news of his personal response to the move.but that is what the blair government now seeks to do create a tyranny to defend us from the al qaeda tyranny.the mortal threat back then was a scruffy little austrian called adolf hitler.thirty more years 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even ira bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.now the blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.the citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.to be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.our own bombs and bullets will can only shatter peace, because invading foreign nations, imprisoning the innocent and 'hunting' in the 'shadows' cannot destroy an evil of the mind, and hatred within the heart.i agree with frederick forsyth.we really can't deal with terrorism by turning britain into a fascist state.if they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.our security services, behave like the detective who having decided that a certain person is guilty, rakes over all kinds of obscure and flimsy evidence to try and prove it, while the real villain gets away.in this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like mr.yes, there has been oppression by the british government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc.this country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people defined by whom .when id cards become mandatory, the data collected will not be protected by the data protection act, and will be readily available to people like gchq, with no control by the person whose id is being checked.forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001.the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.you now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.i agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass hysteria and talking up the threat but talking down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.the problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.however, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty i hope this will prove to be one step too far.as somebody of chinese origin, i can say that this country used to be a good place to migrate and start a new life.we have a prime minister who spends too much time meddling in us politics and affairs which have little to do with the lives of british citizens at home or abroad.terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.i absolutely agree with frederick forsyth.what is really worrying is the enthusiasm of mr blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.if the government has its way with id cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.i am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that british people have enjoyed for centuries the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.that goes right back to magna carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they knew best .frederick forsyth puts it beautifully.the government is seeking to introduce a police state.the new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory id cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un british idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.wake up an interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat 1 if these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they will use them without fear of mutually assured destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.2 the terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the london underground and we could do very little to stop it.because these terrorists are potentially so deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest and for how long they were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.i don't usually have much time for mr forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.there is no doubt that there are terrorist organisations who would like to do harm to the u.add to this this new legislation which effectively means that the protection of the law will be removed from anyone at the whim of the home secretary, and i genuinely wonder what sort of world my two children will inherit.k. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.mr forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.these laws and the emphasis on the islamic threat will just do the same.the nature of the current threat is new.at this time, let us not forget, suspects foreign and british were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.i'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack freddie forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the uk.people like forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite new labour and tony blair.i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth.the very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.the perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.at what point will they feel they have enough control over every single person in the british isles when we are all tagged and monitored constantly our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.i am against a police state and would not like to think that i lived in one.i think that the attack on iraq made the international situation worse and may have provoked further acts of terrorism.mr forsyth has forgotten one key point the terrorists who threaten britain today are well aware that hitler, stalin, and the ira all failed.that does not mean that the civil liberties of modern britain must be eroded to counter the threat that should always be the absolute last resort.but to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.frederic forsythe's comments seem to me to be a well thought out analysis of why we human society as a whole, and britain in particular should resist the temptation to over protect through fear.it's all very well criticising that policy, but if mr forsythe can't draw on his years of experience to offer an alternative, i say 'so what ' to his opinions.this government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.it is frederick forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.i rarely find myself agreeing with my forsyth, but in this instance i think he is correct.if the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next i agree absolutely.terrorist attacks will take place but for many reasons we should take that personal risk in return for personal freedom.the single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.the british government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.although, in principle i agree with him, frederick forsyth fails to address one key point al qaeda attacks though obviously there have been none yet in the uk seek to kill the maximum number of people.forsyth's views.the british government is not going down the road that mr forsyth suggests.sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who, mr.forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little austrian.like new labour, he called himself a libertarian.like new labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.but as forsythe criticises this government, hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.i agree with mr forsyth's views.the governments approach is totally against the spirit of british democracy.of course frederick is wrong about britain winning the war against the ira and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.we can have no moral justification for imposing our system of government on anyone while we are systematically depriving our own citizens of basic individual and collective freedoms.the problem i see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.but history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.if we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.i never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by frederick forsyth, but i'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.we, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods.this government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the european convention on human rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.just look at the facts our government along with the us invaded another sovereign country iraq by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.if individuals are treated in the same distorted way, then we've done ourselves more damage than any terrorist organisation could with bombs.i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.mr forsyth links islamic fundamentalism to the new threat .the people who mr forsyth labels the new threat are those who do not follow the correct teachings of islam.on top of that, they claim to be following islam in its true form i accept that the intentions of these policies are to make britain a safer place but i cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference in northern ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the ira with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the british.being eight years older than frederick forsyth and a survivor of the blitz on london, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.during the ira bombings there were massive explosions in canary wharf, to the right of where i write this, and also to the left in the city of london.
