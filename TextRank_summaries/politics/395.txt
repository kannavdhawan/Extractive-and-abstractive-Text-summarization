blair ready to call election tony blair seems certain to end weeks of phoney war on monday and announce there will be a general election on 5 may.the prime minister and his campaign boss alan milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between labour's stability and investment against tory cuts and boom and bust.and it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.during the phoney campaign, labour got into trouble over its central claim that michael howard was planning 35 bn cuts in public services.the prime minister found himself struggling to explain how a smaller, slower increase in spending planned by the tories compared to labour's plans was a cut.and it looked like the labour campaign which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by mr howard on issues such as immigration and health was on the rocks.a second central argument will be over taxation, with the tories claiming the chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if labour wins again.
