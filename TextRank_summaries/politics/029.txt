uk set to cut back on embassies nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced.mr straw said the move would save 6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.in a written statement, mr straw said the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office's strategic priorities, including counter proliferation, counter terrorism, energy and climate change.some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts.in africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane.since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed excluding wednesday's cuts but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened.but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected, he said.
