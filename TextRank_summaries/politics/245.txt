the proposals include cutting scotland's six single battalion regiments to five and merging these into a super regiment.when ministers announced a reorganisation of the army it drew a question mark over the futures of the black watch, the kings own scottish borderers, the royal scots, the royal highland fusiliers and the argyll and sutherland highlanders.the proposals to either merge or amalgamate the six regiments into a super regiment sparked a political outcry, with labour backbenchers and opposition politicians opposing the plan.speaking ahead of the expected army board meeting, a spokesman said the government and the army board have spent the past four months attempting to trick serving soldiers and the public into thinking their planned changes for the scottish regiments are for the good of the army and for that of the serving soldier.an alternative blueprint had been put forward by labour mp eric joyce, who proposed going ahead with the merger while preserving the other regiments.speaking in scotland last week, mr blair said the aim was to preserve tradition but introduce a more effective structure and hinted that a super regiment was likely.the prime minister said he hoped campaigners' concerns would be taken into account but the need for effective change had to be paramount.
