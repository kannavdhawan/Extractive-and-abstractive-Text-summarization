amitai etzioni, a key influence on new labour thinking, says the us emphasis on an axis of evil is misplaced.the priority should instead be on failing states , including russia and pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues.in a report for the foreign policy centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.that means there is an urgent need to curb terrorists' access to nuclear arms and the materials used to make them.we must recognise that we will be unable to stop all attacks and thus ensure terrorists will not be able to strike with weapons of mass destruction, prof etzioni continues.he suggests so called rogue states such as iran and north korea are less of a problem than failed and failing states , which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials.
