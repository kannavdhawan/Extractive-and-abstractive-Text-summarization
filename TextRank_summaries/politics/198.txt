police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of 24 drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change.andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 february.the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24 hour drinking should be re examined because of a binge drinking epidemic .however, mr hayman said it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, 'i'm very sorry'.he said that police should make sure that responsible people who wanted a change could benefit from more liberal legislation.however, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24 hour drinking.the conservatives have called for 24 hour drinking to be shelved until the problems of binge drinking are solved.lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said it would clearly be prudent to allow the police and local authorities more time to prepare for flexible drinking hours.chief constable mr hayman acknowledged that binge drinking did cause problems.
