malik rejects all black mp lists a call for ethnic minority shortlists to boost the number of black and asian mps has been rejected by one of labour's most senior asians.shahid malik, who is on labour's ruling nec, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities.that came after it emerged that one of britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, west ham, was to get a women only shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling.for example in west ham, this might allow only women and minorities to seek to be candidates.appearing on bbc radio 4's today programme, mr malik, who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates.labour mp diane abbot, who backs mr phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps keith vaz, paul boateng and bernie grant in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat.we haven't ruled out all black shortlists and welcome a debate in the party about this, he said.
