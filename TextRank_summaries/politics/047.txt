student 'fee factor' played down a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.in june last year, mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by 2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed.director, david caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities, but this was not a major factor.he told bbc radio scotland's good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context.he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge an additional figure of about 200.
