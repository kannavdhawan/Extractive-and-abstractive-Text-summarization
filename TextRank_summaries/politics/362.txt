brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that didn't stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties' core election foxes.specifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families.so if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from mr brown's red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government.like a surgeon, he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign.where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering, mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown's forecasts to the prime minister's forecasts on iraq's weapons of mass destruction.as ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor's red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws.in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal.and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election.
