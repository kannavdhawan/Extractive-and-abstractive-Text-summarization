tory leader unveils spending plan tory leader michael howard says his party can save 35bn in government spending by tackling waste.the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes.the bulk of the 35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, mr howard said.almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes, mr howard insisted.so part of the 12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing.mr howard is expected to say that around 6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday.the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble shooter david james.mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less.however, chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is 35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard.liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added people will not be taken in by michael howard's claims of 35bn worth of savings.
