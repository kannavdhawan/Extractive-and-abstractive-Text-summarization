mps criticise child access system divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, mps have said.the constitutional affairs select committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access.courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, mps said.an arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position, the mps said.they said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non resident parent in contested cases.at the moment, far too many contact and residency cases are being dealt with by the courts when they could be better resolved through professional mediation and negotiation, he said.
