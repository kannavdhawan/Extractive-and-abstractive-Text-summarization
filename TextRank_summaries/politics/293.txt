kilroy launches 'veritas' party ex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party.mr kilroy silk, who recently quit the uk independence party, said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration.he told a london news conference that veritas latin for truth would avoid the old parties' lies and spin .ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk.mr kilroy silk promised a firm but fair policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining an already crowded field on the right of british politics .on thursday mr kilroy silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat.he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members, damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader.ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.mr kilroy silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had gone awol after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections.while ukip has turned its back on the british people, i shall not, he said.mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy silk would deliver better as the leader of a eurosceptic party.its leader, roger knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy silk.he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye', he said.ukip officials also argue mr kilroy silk has not been straightforward in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.veritas it's the bnp in an expensive suit it's all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming, that 'veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in lies and spin , but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two horse race trend.in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy silk opposing geoff hoon good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.let's hope kilroy silk, ukip and the euro sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe.whatever kilroy silk and ukip do, none of their anti european policies have any relevance outside middle england.hopefully this all this fighting within euro sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the usa forever at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election.brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long you've got to hand it to kilroy silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self belief.the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old british' name is this indicative of the man contradictory, vain and pompous i think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point.british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.if mr kilroy silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.as one of kilroy silk's east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity.ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not.this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy.the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy silk but for the ukip.kilroy silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip's party list.good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.kilroy silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.as the main eurosceptic party, ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe.having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.thank goodness that kilroy silk has gone now ukip at least has a chance in the election it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip.robert kilroy silk could have a lot to offer.under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.this kilroy silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes.veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy silk.if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.so ukip was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti europe feeling in this country.it's all flash and no real policy here let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy silk slipping into obscurity.
