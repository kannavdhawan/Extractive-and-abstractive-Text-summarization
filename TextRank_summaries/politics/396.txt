the information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the lib dems about how labour uses its call centres.the lib dems say labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.it says calls are not marketing if they just ask about people's voting intentions.the party says it would expect the watchdog to take complaints seriously but it has clear legal advice on the issue.his letter to the commissioner quotes from a labour party handbook about identifying target voters .and it quotes a stevenage labour party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.mr taylor tells the commissioner it is clear beyond peradventure from the above that the labour party is engaging in a large scale voter id project for subsequent promotional purposes through targeted and segmented mailings.the lib dems raised worries about labour and conservative calls in february and 680 people have signed up to the website they set up to help people to complain.a party official said there was only scattered evidence of the tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about labour.a spokeswoman for the information commissioner's office said it was examining one complaint about political calls understood to be mr taylor's.the commissioner's office will now examine the lib dem evidence.labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making voter identification calls.as the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law.
