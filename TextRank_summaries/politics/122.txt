tories plan migrant health checks non european union citizens wanting to work in the uk will have to undergo tests for tuberculosis and hiv, under plans unveiled by the conservatives.a positive test for tb would mean visa applications being turned down, while hiv would be dealt with case by case.leader michael howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the nhs.the proposals, which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election, would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching.nearly two thirds of people with tb are born abroad, said mr howard.but mr howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims.the proposals include people coming to the uk from outside the eu for between six and 12 months from a high incidence tb country will have to undergo a chest x ray.the tests will include a health check, chest x rays for tb except for children and pregnant women and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16 year olds.immigration minister des browne quoted its five year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high risk areas at the entry clearance stage.in fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status, she said.
