muslims discuss election concerns issues that muslims should be considering before voting in the next general election are to be debated by uk community representatives.last year mab, which opposed the war in iraq, urged muslims not to vote for labour in the european elections.this meeting is not anti party in particular, it's anti policy, it's on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on, mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday's event.dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq, the palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic, social and education problems.the chairman of the mcb's public affairs committee, sher khan, said the war in iraq would be a significant factor affecting muslims' voting intentions.for the most part the labour constituencies where there's a large muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe, professor curtice said.the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green, in east london, and rochdale in lancashire, he added.in bethnal green, former labour mp george galloway, who founded the anti war party respect, is standing against sitting mp oona king, who had a 10,000 vote majority in 2001.but professor curtice said the muslim anti war vote could be split between the liberal democrats and respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.
