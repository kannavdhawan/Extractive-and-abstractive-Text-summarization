the tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the anti terrorism bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in november.mr blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already.mr blair's refusal to accept the tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the lords.the bill proposes control orders , which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.these would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.the tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest.in the commons, mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through .mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.the lib dems plan to oppose the bill in the lords on thursday.
