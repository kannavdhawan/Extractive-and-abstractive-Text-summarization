lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence.the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf's wishes.in written evidence to the committee, lord woolf said i have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue .judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said.he argued the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved.lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns.what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement on appointing a judge , it doesn't happen, he said.as lord woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice.parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.
