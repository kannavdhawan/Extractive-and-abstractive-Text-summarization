lib dems target the student vote students can decide the fate of mps in some seats at the next election, liberal democrat leader charles kennedy has claimed.the party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll.the lib dems say scrapping university fees wins them student support.but the tories would also end fees and labour says both would cap people's ambitions.he underlined lib dem plans to scrap university fees and reintroduce maintenance grants of up to 2,000.labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to 3,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non repayable support of up to 3,000.ahead of mr kennedy's launch, a labour spokesperson said like the tories, the liberal democrats would restrict access to higher education and put a cap on aspiration, closing the door to students with good grades and restricting their life ambitions.they are committed to abandoning labour's targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30 year olds going into higher education and under lib dem plans students would even have to study near home.the lib dem analysis of the difference students could make to its election chances is based on all students being registered to vote near their university, not in their home towns.
