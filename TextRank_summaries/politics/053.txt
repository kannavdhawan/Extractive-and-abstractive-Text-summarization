viktor makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities, who promised he would live like an average british citizen .but despite a 65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension.oleg gordievsky, a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british, said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985.commenting on mr makarov's case, he said the british state is not a fat cow it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week.i believe the government of the united kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities took the information that victor makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold, mr kahn said.within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the british authorities he'd been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an mi6 agent in latvia.he was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average uk citizen.but after arriving in london 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled.but he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him.
