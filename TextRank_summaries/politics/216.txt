javier solana, eu foreign policy chief, says phone tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries.human rights groups, top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases.mr solana told itv1's jonathan dimbleby programme phone tap evidence in court works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it.under the anti terrorism crimes and security act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge.human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial.the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.
