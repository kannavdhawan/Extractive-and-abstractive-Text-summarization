the electoral commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws.chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system.there have been rare cases when household pets have been put on the electoral roll, the mps heard.and some people have registered all their family, regardless of their age birth dates are not included on the forms so election officers cannot easily check.mr younger said using the royal mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.there have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form.currently, british voters have to re register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running.mr younger suggested the re registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up to date.
