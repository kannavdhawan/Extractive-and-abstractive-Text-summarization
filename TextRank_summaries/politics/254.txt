could rivalry overshadow election tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster a behind closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue.lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.and it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip.few in westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories, they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.mr blair talked about the new labour manifesto a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year.for his part, mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re elected.one only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound mr brown's leadership ambitions.it is no secret in westminster, for example, that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.
