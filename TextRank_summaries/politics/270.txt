defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely calculated timing, tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending.with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election, mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories' resolutely depressing poll showings.the big idea is his 35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.but mr howard announced that, of the 35bn he has earmarked from savings, 12bn will be used to plug labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin's first budget.at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less .it is the tories' attempt to open that famed clear blue water between them and the labour party and return to a traditional tory agenda that will both reassure the middle england voters who have abandoned him and appeal to core conservative voters.so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact.the election is not going to be decided on what robert jackson did, he added.and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda.
