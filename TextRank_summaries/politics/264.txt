the prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto.and there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly new labour although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.there was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a new labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society .his was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what new labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach.home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it.the highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditions .under what is to be the general election slogan britain is working , the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly new labour.an unremittingly new labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them.the chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance, although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle.with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.
