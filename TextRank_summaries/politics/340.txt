charles kennedy is pledging a maternity income guarantee and a pension system based on years of residence rather than national insurance payments.both labour and the conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support.he says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children.the lib dem's citizen's pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, mr kennedy argues.under the package, new mothers would be offered minimum guaranteed maternity pay of 170 a week for the first six months after the birth of their first child.mr kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing illiberal id cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too.during the interview mr kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party's general election campaign around the birth of his first child, which is expected in april.in september, trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if labour won a third term.the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer.
