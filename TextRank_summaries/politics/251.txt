brown and blair face new rift claims for the umpteenth time, tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster an issue many hoped and believed was above such things.it dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour.so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown's long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting.he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.as far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options.it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform.the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister's turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other.the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.
