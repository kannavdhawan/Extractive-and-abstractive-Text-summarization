a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout.junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced.the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister odpm and the department for constitutional affairs dca .it said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household.figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll.odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could dramatically reduce the chances of fraud .the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in 2002.
