the finance minister has urged councils to limit increases but they have warned that they will struggle to maintain services unless funding is increased.scottish finance minister, tom mccabe msp, said last week in parliament i announced an additional 419m for core expenditure to local government in scotland.that's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.mr mccabe is also looking for local authorities to become more efficient and save money in coming years.the councils' umbrella organisation cosla, which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services.however, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services, a cosla spokesman said.cosla says that it is willing to work with the executive on finding efficiency savings but that these will not be enough to maintain services.scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could put up, what we've seen over the years is more and more burdens being put onto local authorities and the council tax payer having to pick up the bill.there are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced.linda knox, director of the scottish local authority management centre at strathclyde university, said with this current settlement the increase is slowing.
