campaign 'cold calls' questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls .the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls.but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.when we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not, he said.a spokesman for the information commissioner's office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person.if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing, he said.the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future.mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
