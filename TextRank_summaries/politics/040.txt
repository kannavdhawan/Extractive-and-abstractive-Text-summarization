lords wrong on detainees straw jack straw has attacked the decision by britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.the foreign secretary said the right to life was the most important liberty and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism.new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men dealing a major blow to the government's anti terror policy.the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary, he told bbc radio 4's today programme.but liberal democrat peer lord carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released.the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us.any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported.on thursday, lord bingham a senior law lord said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not britons.
