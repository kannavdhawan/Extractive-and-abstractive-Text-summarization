both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters, with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories' new headquarters in victoria street, just down the road from the commons.along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy, he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare to work scheme, which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300,000 in unemployment.and they ridiculed the claims made on monday by michael howard that he could save 35 billion of labour waste and inefficiency to spend on public services while also offering 4 billion of tax cuts.labour has come up with a figure of 22 billions worth of efficiency savings so, understandably perhaps, believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra 13 billion.these figures, based on the two parties' own detailed studies, will be battered to within an inch of their lives during the campaign.
