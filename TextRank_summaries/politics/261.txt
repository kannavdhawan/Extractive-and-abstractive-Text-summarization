if press reports are to be believed, alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of labour's next election manifesto.but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning, as they joined john prescott to unveil labour's latest poster campaign.but, sadly, it wasn't the cabinet who had raided the dressing up box just six rather ill at ease looking labour students.two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for 200 years .another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the 1960s .the event may have been designed to highlight labour's economic success under mr brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge.mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour's shared purpose and united dedication .it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming labour has met all of its promises.the event was carefully stage managed to underline cabinet unity.and, more specifically, to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn.
