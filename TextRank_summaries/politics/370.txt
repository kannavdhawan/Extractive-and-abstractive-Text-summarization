it follows a home office move to cut asylum claims by stopping people, mostly roma, from boarding flights to britain from the czech capital, prague.but she said they were treated more sceptically than non roma passengers by immigration officers acting on racial grounds .lady hale said immigration officers should have treated all would be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.liberty said statistics suggested roma czechs were 400 times more likely to be stopped by british immigration officials at prague airport than non roma czechs.it took up the case of six unnamed roma czechs refused entry to britain, and that of the european roma rights centre, which said the measures unfairly penalised roma people.responding to the ruling, a home office spokesman said the scheme was operated two years ago as a short term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the uk.welcoming the ruling, maeve sherlock, chief executive of the refugee council, said human rights abuses against the roma in eastern europe are well documented, and it is hugely troubling that the government sought to deny entry to such a vulnerable group.amnesty international's jan shaw said that the government's own asylum policy was being operated discriminatorily is bleakly ironic given that discrimination often lies at the heart of serious human rights abuse, not least in the czech republic.
