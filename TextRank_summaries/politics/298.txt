'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a 10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it.it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200.all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog.the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from 20m to 15m.he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.
