the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation, he said.in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council sgc , the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be weighed carefully by a judge so they did not lead to an inappropriately short sentence .where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines.director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald qc, who sits on the sgc, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.it represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity, he said.
