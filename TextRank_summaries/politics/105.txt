muslim police stops 'more likely' uk muslims should accept that people of islamic appearance are more likely to be stopped and searched by police, a home office minister has said.hazel blears said innocent muslims would be targeted because of the search for islamic extremists.on ministers of religions, such as imams, she said faith groups would be asked what other qualifications and skills, such as civic knowledge and ability to engage the community, should be demanded.the minister had been saying she understood there was a perception that stop and search was aimed at one community, but that was not what was happening, the spokesman said.statistics showed that of the 17 people found guilty of terrorist acts in the uk since the 11 september attacks, only four of the 12 whose ethnic backgrounds were known were muslim, he added figures published last week showed that people from ethnic minorities were increasingly likely to be targeted by police stop and search tactics.figures showed that, for 2003 2004, asians were 1.9 times more likely to be stopped and searched, compared with 1.7 times more likely in the previous year.separate figures on police searches in england and wales carried out under the terrorism act 2000 showed that ethnic minorities were more likely to be targeted.muslim groups have repeatedly claimed that their communities are being victimised under terror laws.last july, the police were accused of islamophobia by muslim groups after stop and search figures showed the numbers of asians targeted had risen by 300% since the introduction of anti terror laws.
