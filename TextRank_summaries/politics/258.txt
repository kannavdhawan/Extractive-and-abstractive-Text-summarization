labour mps' fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.and it was largely that fear that led to tony blair and gordon brown being read the riot act during a meeting of the parliamentary labour party.the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.it is a sentiment that is now running throughout the labour benches with mps eager to underline the message to their leaders to stop the squabbling and get on with the job at hand.stephen pound echoed the message, saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the labour party but for this country, is the appearance of division.even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that, while mr brown is in africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.none the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand.
