taxes must be trusted kennedy public trust in taxes is breaking down because labour and tories are not being straight with people on the issue, lib dem leader charles kennedy has said.a day ahead of the government's pre budget report, mr kennedy used a speech to say his party was facing up to painful economic realities .other parties have accused the lib dems of making uncosted promises.the lib dems would cut low priority spending, including the government's id cards scheme and the child trust fund.now they say the only simple tax rise they want is a new 50% tax band for top earners to pay for scrapping university tuition fees, providing free personal care for elderly and disabled people and keeping local taxes down.mr kennedy said that contract with the people that the government will only tax fairly and will spend their money wisely can only be sustained if the political parties are straightforward about their plans.with the stealth tax strategy of gordon brown, the obvious unfairness of our current tax system especially the council tax, and the empty promises of the conservative party on this issue it is no wonder that trust in taxation is breaking down.conservative co chairman liam fox said liam fox said if charles kennedy is serious about making his budgets add up he should start by explaining how they would fund their 100 spending commitments.and chancellor gordon brown said the lib dem figures did not add up.
