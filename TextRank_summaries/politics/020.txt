concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england's secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report.the government's response to the plan for a four tier diploma to replace all existing 14 19 qualifications is expected next week.it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half hearted response, said the chairman of the commons education select committee, labour mp barry sheerman.his main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.the qca said the potential step change in participation and attainment lay in the integrity of the whole diploma.the chief inspector of schools, david bell, also said recently that gcses and a levels should go.universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students.it has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, professor chris woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval .the conservative party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top a level grade, no matter how well the others have done.
