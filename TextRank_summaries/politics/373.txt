earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984.but a uk government official responded even with the rebate, the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget.earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a crucial test of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain.eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end.mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.the uk, france, germany, austria, the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%.mr straw has said the eu commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.shadow europe minister mr brady said i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it's a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.the foreign secretary meanwhile said the justice of the rebate remained.there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods, he said.britain's low unemployment meant there was less neurosis about people coming from eastern european countries.in countries like germany and france, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in, he said.
