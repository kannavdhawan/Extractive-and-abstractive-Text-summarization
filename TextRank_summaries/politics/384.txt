it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights.deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001.under the proposed changes prompted by the house of lords ruling the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects.mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats.the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat, he told mps.there have been calls for the rules for wire tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change.he suggested changing the law to let security cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be very high indeed and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws.shami chakrabarti, from human rights group liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials.
