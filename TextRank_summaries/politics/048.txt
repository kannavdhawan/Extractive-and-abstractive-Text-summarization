anglers 'could face prosecution' anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of mps has warned.sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.the mps said they were concerned the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.they called for a cast iron guarantee that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing.the draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect kept animals and companion animals by setting up a duty of care .however, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity, the committee added.mps urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences.but mr jack said the bill very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms.
