kelly trails new discipline power teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a zero tolerance drive, education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems.the minister also confirmed she received spiritual support from the catholic movement opus dei.she told bbc one's breakfast with frost it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom.but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled.i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision.asked if she was a member of the group, ms kelly said i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right.she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister.ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place, he said.this is an all talk agenda that lets down children, teachers and parents.
