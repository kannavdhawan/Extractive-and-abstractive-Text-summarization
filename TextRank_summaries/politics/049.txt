clarke to press on with id cards new home secretary charles clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for id cards despite a call for him to pause for thought from charles kennedy.the lib dem leader said david blunkett's resignation was a good opportunity to question whether the legislation was necessary.but mr clarke said he had supported the plans when mr blunkett argued for them in cabinet and he supported them now.id cards are a means to creating a more secure society, he said.mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been significantly influenced by the recommendations of the commons' home affairs committee.earlier mr kennedy, whose party opposes the id cards plan as deeply flawed said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place he asked.the first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.
