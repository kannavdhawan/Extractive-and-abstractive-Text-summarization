campaign 'cold calls' questioned labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing cold calls .the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.when we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not, he said.assistant information commissioner phil jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned, said mr jones.if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations.in summary, whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed.mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.
