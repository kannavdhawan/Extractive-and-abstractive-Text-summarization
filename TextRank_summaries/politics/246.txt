student 'inequality' exposed teenagers from well off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%.sir howard said the report highlighted the entrenched divisions between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem.tuition fees and student loans in england and wales and the different fee regime in scotland did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest.the report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 up from 6% in 1994.the higher education minister, kim howells, said we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.the group which represents university vice chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.
