goldsmith denies war advice claim the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the pm.in a statement, lord goldsmith said i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer.he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre war intelligence.the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.earlier, tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion.on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, tory mp michael mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry, told the bbc that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule.the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan's involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc, a member of cherie blair's matrix chambers.he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.a short statement about lord goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 just before a crucial commons vote on the military action did not suggest this.former minister clare short, who resigned from the government over the iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.
