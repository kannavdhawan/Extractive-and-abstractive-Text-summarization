ban on hunting comes into force fox hunting with dogs is now illegal in england and wales after a ban on the activity came into force overnight.the law faces a stiff test this weekend, with the countryside alliance saying many hunts will be out in force.chief police officers spokesman nigel yeo said he expected most people would obey the law by drag hunting or chasing foxes then shooting them.he said police would challenge the one of two isolated hunts which are threatening to break the law.the definitions of legal and illegal hunting are so blurred that the police are being asked to make impossible judgements.the attorney general, lord goldsmith, has so far issued no instructions to police on how they should deal with hunters who violate the law.under the new law hunters have a number of legal options available to them.as well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to flush out foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them.
