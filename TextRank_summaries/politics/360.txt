will the budget bring out smiling voters as tory spokesman oliver letwin said any chancellor would use his pre election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he.that is the size of the financial black hole the tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should labour win.previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending.the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax.but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years.
