councils are also to be given stronger powers to move on illegal settlements by gypsy communities on rural land.more money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister yvette cooper.in november, mps urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop.ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places.there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites, said ms cooper.that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites, as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short term because of risk to local amenity and the environment.many mps with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern england, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments.in their november report, mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop.
