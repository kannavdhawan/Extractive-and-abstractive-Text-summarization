'more to do' on adult literacy the government will only hit its target for improving adult maths and literacy skills if courses are made more attractive, a report says.the national audit office praised ministers for reaching the benchmark of 750,000 adults in england gaining basic qualifications by this year.some 26 million adults lack maths or english skill levels expected of school leavers.according to the report, more than half the qualifications achieved were by learners aged 16 to 18.auditor general sir john bourn said higher levels of literacy and numeracy will benefit england both socially and economically.the report recommends gathering more details on the educational needs of areas, so courses can be set to meet local demand.existing adult learners could use their enthusiasm, commitment and local knowledge to attract other people.an estimated 5.2 million adults have worse literacy than that expected of 11 year olds, while 14.9 million have numeracy skills below this level.education minister ivan lewis said we will continue to use creative ways of involving people with the lowest skill levels and the report shows that our efforts are gathering pace.shadow education secretary tim collins said this is the third report in two days to highlight labour's failure to ensure young people acquire the necessary levels of literacy and numeracy for their working life.
