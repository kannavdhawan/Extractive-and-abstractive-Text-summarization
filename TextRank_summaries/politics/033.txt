baa's expansion of stansted airport in essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans.baa also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion, heathrow anti noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth.their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport, or when it changed take off and landing procedures at heathrow.the campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the isle of sheppey east of london.but baa has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.at heathrow, gatwick, edinburgh and glasgow airports, baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004, which will close next week.at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.
