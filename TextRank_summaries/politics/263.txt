the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree they'd be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word.each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.in the case of mr blair and mr brown, successive books are published, ensuring the issues never die.now this isn't because the participants are stupid it's actually each individual behaving entirely rationally, given the incentives facing them.it's often referred to as the prisoner's dilemma , based on a parable much told in economics degree courses.the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime, and are locked up in separate cells.but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime.without a confession, the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge.he tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess and they are the only one to confess they'll be let off their crime.and if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life.the result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off.both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.what economics tells us is that once you're in a prisoners' dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over it's hard to escape the perverse logic of it.in the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.
