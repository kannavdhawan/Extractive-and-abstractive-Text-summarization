not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions.of that, 23 billion would go on spending plans, with 8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election.it is a move back towards an almost traditional tory message which previously suggested labour was the party of tax rises and the conservatives the party of tax cuts.the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters.and that is where one of the problems lies for mr howard can he persuade sceptical voters that they really can have it both ways with bigger spending on public services and lower taxes he insists he will not promise anything before the election that he cannot deliver if put into downing street.so far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third new labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances.so, mr howard hopes his message will start to hit home during this unofficial election campaign and that his poll ratings might finally lift off the floor.
