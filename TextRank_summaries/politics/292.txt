ukip mep attacked german 'empire' a uk independence party mep suggested germany saw the eu as an 'empire' and was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed.mike nattrass, ukip's deputy leader, made the comments to an audience at a meeting during last september's hartlepool by election campaign.the meeting was shown in a bbc 3 film on ex ukip mep robert kilroy silk.the documentary showed mr nattrass, apparently talking about the eu, telling the meeting the germans are the big losers here but they don't care because to them the project is worthwhile.on tuesday, he told the bbc news website he did not think the comments were offensive and worked happily with meps of different nationalities in the european parliament.the documentary showed some of the tensions between mr kilroy silk and his fellow meps after ukip took third place in last year's european elections.asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, mr kilroy silk said there was one thing i said that i shouldn't have said at the time.the film also included footage of a row between mr kilroy silk, mep nigel farage and party leader roger knapman about rumours that he was about to resign the ukip whip in the european parliament.mr kilroy silk told them he had not left the ukip group a move he announced shortly after the meeting.ukip officials claim it was in fact mr kilroy silk, not mr farage, who briefed newspapers he was leaving the group of meps.mr kilroy silk separately said he had argued against ukip working with such groups which believed homosexuality was a sin.a ukip spokesman said there were more than 40 meps in the same group in the european parliament.he did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views just as mr kilroy silk had a right to criticise arab states.
