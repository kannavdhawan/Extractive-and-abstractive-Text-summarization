the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.but immigrants' group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants jcwi says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge.under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.but from tuesday all non eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'.these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court, ms beynon said.the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights.the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added.the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions.registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married, mr rimmer said.
