chancellor rallies labour voters gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the stakes are too high to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.the chancellor said the poll expected to fall on 5 may would give a clear and fundamental choice between labour investment and tory cuts.the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means testing under labour.to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country.laying into the conservative's record in government he said i give you this promise with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, 3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of 35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 60bn more.turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, george osborne, said this was more talk from gordon brown.there will be a simple choice at the election value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown.for all his trumpeting of labour's management of the economy, gordon brown's record is very mixed, he said.
