lib dems target first time buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build 100,000 new affordable homes on publicly owned land.the party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder.labour has already announced plans to help first time buyers and the tories would extend right to buy schemes.the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.the party says its help for first time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer.the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes.labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes.housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government's strategy.mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour's promise to spend 42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.
