the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments.instead, scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending.the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.ministers thought merging the prison service with the council controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer.she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday, aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community .a national advisory board on offender management will also be created to advise ms jamieson on the sps's role and performance in reducing reoffending.communities who are paying the price for this reoffending both in terms of crime and in terms of prison costs expect better.
