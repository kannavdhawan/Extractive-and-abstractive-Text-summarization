'few ready' for information act thousands of public bodies are ill prepared for the freedom of information act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say mps.but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an unusually high turnover of staff within the department, which had seriously interfered with its work, said the constitutional affairs select committee.the dca had failed to provide early guidance on technical matters and shown a lack of consistent leadership , the mps found.committee chairman alan beith said the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared.our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking.
