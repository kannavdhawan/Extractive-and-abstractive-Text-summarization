tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut 35bn in wasteful spending to allow 4bn in tax cuts.on saturday, tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour.in his speech, mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts.mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both britain's hard won economic stability the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades and the key investment in public services.it's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government.in response, david davis said the tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match labour's spending on health and education.the chancellor said the conservatives' plans would see some 50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the tories deny.mr brown warned that the tories were planning the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto .meanwhile, tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the party's proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans.once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election which taxes will they put up to fill the 8bn shortfall in their plans
