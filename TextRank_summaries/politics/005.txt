ed balls, ex chief economic adviser to the treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day.but mr balls, a prospective labour mp, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules.he was speaking as sir digby jones, cbi director general, warned mr brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre election bribes.mr balls, who stepped down from his treasury post to stand as a labour candidate in the election, had suggested that mr brown would meet his golden economic rule with a margin to spare .he also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party's chances of winning.if the mpc the bank of england's monetary policy committee were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy and i'm not predicting that they will i do not believe that this will be a big election issue in britain for labour, he told a parliamentary lunch.i don't think we'll see a pre election spending spree we certainly did not see that before 2001, he said.his assurances came after sir digby jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills.i think that gordon brown wants to be part of the successful labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a conservative party that will take britain backwards, mr balls told today.
