escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded.michael ferguson, 36, escaped after being allowed out of the high security carstairs unit.the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval.an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report.the scottish national party's parliamentary leader argued that under the law, authorisation of ferguson's leave of absence would have come directly from ministers.she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs.however, my understanding is that, under the mental health legislation, the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence, would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers.police said ferguson posed a danger to the public.he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs.the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it.she said ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off.they do have statutory responsibility, but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision.
