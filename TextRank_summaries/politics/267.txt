ukip's secret weapon by any measure, new yorker dick morris is that thing americans love over everything else a winner.so why britain and why ukip which, despite its recent eu election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.but what is it about ukip that particularly attracts him many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics.a great soundbite, but a surprise coming from a new yorker post 11 september.so he is out to help ukip take britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.and he is scathing of the tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.the basic point is that the eu seeks political integration to move the entire nexus of decision making away from britain and we oppose that and the tories cannot be trusted to oppose it .so is ukip's job to destroy the tories, as former member robert kilroy silk once notoriously declared no.i think ukip had a huge amount to do with tony blair's decision to hold a referendum on the european constitution and i think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro .and, while we are on the subject of mr kilroy silk, mr morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.so what is the big plan for the general election.neither does ukip have to fight every seat.as with the 2004 us presidential election, he says, the outcome will be decided by a small number of swing seats just as he believes it will in britain.he also believes it is possible the internet could have a big part in the poll.the internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election through blogs individuals posting their views in online diaries .anything can happen in the next general election.but there is undoubtedly a sense that the next general election may indeed produce some surprises even while most still believe it is labour's for the taking.ukip's performance in last year's european elections was just such a shocker and showed that mr morris may have a point about the new consensus.
