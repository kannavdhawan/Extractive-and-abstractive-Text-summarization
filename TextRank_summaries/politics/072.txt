mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes but labour's majority was reduced to 14.the bill proposes control orders , which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.on monday, mps voted 272 219 in favour of the bill after key concessions from mr clarke.the government earlier saw its 161 strong majority cut to just 14 as a cross party amendment was narrowly rejected by the commons despite the support of 62 labour rebels.mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians.they should consider far more seriously the use of intercept evidence in any trial and i think they should drop the most objectionable proposals, which are for house arrest.but mr clarke told bbc radio 4's today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords.no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made, but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords, he said.mr clarke's proposed amendment will be debated by the lords on tuesday without having been considered by mps.he said it would be possible to rescue the government and make the law tolerable by amending it in the lords.
