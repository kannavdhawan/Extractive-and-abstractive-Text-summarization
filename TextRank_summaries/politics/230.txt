burglar defence guidelines issued householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted providing they were acting honestly and instinctively , new guidelines say.the leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use reasonable force .doing what you honestly and instinctively believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.and the law protects those who use something to hand as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service cps and association of chief police officers acpo .as a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves.the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use grossly disproportionate force.an informal trawl of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted.in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were determined they would be dealt with as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible , it said.
