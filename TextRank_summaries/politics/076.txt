it says there is little evidence the mod's performance had improved, despite the introduction of a smart acquisition policy six years ago.the nao's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach 50bn 14% higher than originally planned.sir john bourn, head of the nao, said the problems showed the principles of the scheme known as smart acquisition had not been consistently applied.a senior defence official, speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle.this year's overspend was significantly less than last year's 3.1bn total, and the defence procurement agency which is responsible for buying defence equipment was improving.lord bach, minister for defence procurement, said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown , but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects .
