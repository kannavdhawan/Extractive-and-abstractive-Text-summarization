csa 'could close', says minister ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve, work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned.a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks.it warned that it could be five years before the csa was fit for purpose , describing it as a failing organisation and in crisis with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations.the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans, including the abandonment option , to be presented to parliament by easter, in case the cs2 computer system could not be made to work.the mps launched their inquiry into the csa's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up.the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.michelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the 57 a week she should be receiving from her ex partner and had faced an on going battle with the csa.theresa may, tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said we have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them.
