eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis, the uk's public spending watchdog has said.the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the eu still had no common definition of fraud.the report said member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the european anti fraud office on a consistent basis.it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003, worth 38.5m 52m euros , up from 831 cases worth 35.7m in 2002.the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.a spokesman for the european anti fraud office said the organisation agreed with the nao's assessment of fraud reporting.
