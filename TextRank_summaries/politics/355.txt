lib dem spokesman vince cable said the public did not know who to believe and the national audit office should judge.responding to the pre budget report, mr cable also attacked labour's unfair and over complicated taxes.mr cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken.mr cable compared that new cost with the 500m needed for britain's role in the entire first gulf war when 80% of the bill had been met through help from european and arab nations.the current economic climate meant britain could not afford the reckless, george bush style tax cutting spree planned by the tories, he said.mr cable said 40% of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of 50%.with that record, he asked why ministers attacked lib dem plans for a new 50% tax rate for the very rich those earning more than 100,000 a year.mr brown earmarked 1bn to help keep down council tax rises next year.he urged the government to scrap the grossly unfair tax completely.it was because he had rejected previous lib dem proposals, such as scrapping the new deal, that britain's economy was successful, claimed mr brown.
