downing street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith's advice.but the conservatives and liberal democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general.the government has consistently refused to publish lord goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war saying such papers have always been kept confidential.but a short statement about lord goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 just before a crucial commons vote on the military action.in his new book, lawless world, philippe sands, a qc and international law professor, suggests the parliamentary answer was written in downing street.after that downing street proceeded to set out his lord goldsmith's view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 march, said mr sands.tory leader michael howard reiterated calls for the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general, warning this issue will not go away.in a statement to newsnight, lord goldsmith said in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003, i explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions.this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement, mr cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an independent legal opinion , not subject to political negotiation of this kind .
