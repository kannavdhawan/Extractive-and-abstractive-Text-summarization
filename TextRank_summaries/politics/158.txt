mr brown told the house that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments.but this financial year, because of volatility in the oil market , he said the duty would be frozen.he said it is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.but this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market i propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties.
