prime minister's questions so who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is ramming through parliament the controversial new anti terror measures without proper debate.he didn't say so, but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism.why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded.the prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament.liberal democrat leader charles kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue.as is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have, once again, just missed the point.
