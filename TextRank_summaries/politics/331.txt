labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using anti semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin.the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti tory.labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members.the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading 2 2 5 .mr howard did not comment on the anti semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday.jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.mr temko said he blamed cock up not conspiracy , saying he did not detect inherent anti semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies.a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row.
