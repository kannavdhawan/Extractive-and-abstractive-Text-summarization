choose hope over fear kennedy voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said charles kennedy.in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and populist scares .he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll.at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.the general election would be a three party struggle, as the conservative party fades away as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands, he said.while the conservatives are re working their populist scares about asylum and the european 'menace', he said.he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.his party instinctively understood the new liberal britain which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said.
