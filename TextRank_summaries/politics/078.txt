the pilot, included in the government's five year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims.separate negotiations to establish a family tracing and returns scheme are believed to be underway with another country.in its five year immigration plan, announced on tuesday, the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children.a spokesman for the home office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children and leave them to rot .we are developing a returns programme for unaccompanied asylum seeking children whose asylum and humanitarian protection claims have been refused, said the spokesman.we have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests and is safe and sustainable.but andrew hogg, spokesman for the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture, said ministers had so far failed to reassure agencies.from what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account, said mr hogg.in albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.the medical foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries.a spokesman for the albanian embassy in london said it was the first it had heard of a scheme, but did not rule out that there had been an agreement between the two countries.
