what the election should really be about a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll.we've called for the state pension to be increased from 79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of 105.45.if we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.they will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support.we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative.but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around.pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue.he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.we haven't worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps.we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid.we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking.it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face.he wanted the issue off the table until after the election.people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk.we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors.with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it.everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.we want choice on the consumer's terms that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers.tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about 750.whatever we do, the public don't like lorries they see us as a complaining minority.
