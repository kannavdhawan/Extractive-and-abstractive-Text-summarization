lib dems' 'bold' election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election.with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.with his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings, while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases.in many ways the argument between the lib dems and the others over taxation and spending echo the sort of arguments that raged between labour and the tories in the 1980s and early 1990s.but, unlike the old tory labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration, with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard's proposals for quotas.mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll.
