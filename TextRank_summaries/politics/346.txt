the word britain is cast on a red background a nod to old labour.and, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so called fagin posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo alan milburn declared, are doing a very good job .mr milburn, in the latest in his series of pre election campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards.not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days, he declared.it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.they could, however, picture michael howard or, of course, tony blair doing it.and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said.
