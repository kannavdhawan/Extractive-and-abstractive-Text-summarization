tories outlining policing plans local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives.party leader michael howard said the new role would replace inconspicuous police authorities.the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised extravagant tory promises on policing.outlining his crime manifesto, mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.mr howard said the authorities were not providing the local accountability that we want to see and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.lord harris, who sits on the executive of association of police authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials .mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a minimum policing guarantee with their chief constables.
