it will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event.for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool, bournemouth and brighton.and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort.the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference.it amazes me that the labour party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.
