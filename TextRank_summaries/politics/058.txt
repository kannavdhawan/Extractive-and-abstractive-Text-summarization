eu china arms ban 'to be lifted' the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections, uk foreign secretary jack straw has said.but he said it was wrong to put china under the same embargo as countries such as zimbabwe and burma.he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july.but he said an eu code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.if it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to china as we have now.mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted.but he said many of washington's objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries.
