new drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink drive limits by a third, a report says.university college london research claims cutting the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg would save 65 lives a year.the research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003.professor allsop said reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's bac blood alcohol content is within 30mg of the current limit.only about one in 50 of those driving during weekend evenings and nights will need to moderate their drinking to achieve this and fewer still at other times.the aa motoring trust said it was not sure what affect dropping the limit would have on drivers' attitudes to drink driving.road safety head andrew howard said it remains to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.he said there had been a 29% drop in the number of drivers being breathalysed since 1997, which he said the government needed to address if it wanted to reduce the danger caused by drink driving.these have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties.
