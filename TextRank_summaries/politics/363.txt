kennedy criticises 'unfair' taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the fundamental unfairness in the tax system in his ninth budget, charles kennedy has said.but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation.the chancellor's announcement that he was to offer a 200 council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem.the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than 450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.on pensions, mr kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children.for most individuals, most families, most households, it adds up to exactly the same thing, said mr kennedy.
