mr boateng, 53, is to become the uk's high commissioner to south africa.the appointment is dependent on labour's re election.chancellor gordon brown said over the past eight years paul's contribution to the treasury and the government has been exceptional and it has been my privilege to have worked closely with him closely at the treasury.mr boateng said i am honoured to be asked to take on this role, especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with south africa and the african continent.mr boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re election in brent south seat had been in danger saying it was one of the safest labour seats in the country .shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said that, if in government, he would refuse to approve either mr boateng's appointment or that of ex cabinet minister helen liddell as high commissioner to australia.mr blair's appointment of paul boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed tony's cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts, he said.
