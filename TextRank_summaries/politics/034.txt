home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using grossly disproportionate force could be prosecuted.on thursday, mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.' mr howard said the grossly disproportionate test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16 year old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm.but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder, said mr clarke.he said the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.
