you'll have forgotten it all tomorrow but you'll have a fun night with the film and all the extras.unusually for this kind of film, the extras don't solely concentrate on the special effects.but as long as you're not expecting a documentary, live with it king arthur is a fun, exciting, totally shallow experience and looks excellent.admit it, the fact that this is one of the shows alan titchmarsh left ground force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy.but titchmarsh turns out to know his subject and the sight of our present day landscape being peeled back to reveal the past was fascinating.
