evans perched on a stool as shoppers wandered around the open fronted shop packed with his furniture.among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows.asked the reason for the sale, evans said i just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache.he added it feels good to be selling this stuff, it's a weight off my mind.however, the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel 4's gameshow don't forget your toothbrush.sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four.to help people in their browsing, evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside.the prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers.some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to evans.ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying 350 for the print.martin hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea.why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it, said mr hellewell.evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom.we'll stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that, said evans.
