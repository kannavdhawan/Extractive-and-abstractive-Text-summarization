jackson film 'absolute disaster' a pr expert has told the michael jackson child abuse trial that the tv documentary at the heart of the case was an absolute disaster .ms kite suggested jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser's family after the airing of martin bashir's film living with michael jackson.jackson's defence questioned ms kite's credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer's team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.ms kite said she received a phone call on 13 february 2003 from a jackson associate, marc schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been staying.in the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.questioned by the prosecution, ms kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius.ms kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against mr jackson.he said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy who was 13 at the time and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.
