bbc 'should allow more scrutiny' mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how 2bn in licence fee money is spent.the public accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a free hand to investigate how the bbc offers value for money.our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money, said the committee chairman, mp edward leigh.a bbc spokeswoman said we share the committee's interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well.the report said the freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service.the bbc launched freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky, to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news 24 to be seen.
