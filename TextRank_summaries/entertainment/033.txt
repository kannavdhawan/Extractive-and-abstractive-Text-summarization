it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted, as they always are, by a calamity that only harry, ron and hermione can put right.emma watson is ever better as hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson.but it is laden with behind the scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast.adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes.you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it, as we did on the first harry potter dvd.the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene, a short featurette about the making of the film's big moments.
