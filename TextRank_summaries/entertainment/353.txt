roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big screen version of the magic roundabout, released in the uk on friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box office gold.recent years have seen a less than successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit's five children and it, previously filmed by the bbc in 1991.with screen versions of the a team, the dukes of hazzard and even blake's seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business.the new version of the magic roundabout, which will be released as sprung in the us, replaces the stop motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished, computer generated animation.in a similar fashion, the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original's puppets and models.pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout, while the now defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song.and the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors' outrage that gerry anderson's thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins.dan jolin, reviews editor of empire magazine, says classic children's tv shows have a built in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.what's next the clangers on some distant planet, with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds' disappointing global box office performance the film cost 42m 22m but only recouped 21m 11m the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating.how about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his money thundercats i loved it.should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy.you forgot to mention the grearest of them all, danger mouse but then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it it's always nice to see these old toons re released, but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think i've been completely put off.as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series.personally i'd like to see cartoons such as transformers, thundercats and m.leave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect.just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved.dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.i have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film.it's all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation.it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film makers running out of original ideas all i can say is bring back danger mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever.again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.we live in a sampling world the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new.seems that the film and tv is doing the same now it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin.if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character.tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes, dj's are sampling or re working 70's and 80's music.personally, i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our misty eyed nostalgia alone.it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today's film makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia.there are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent films or tv programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past mr.i'm an expat living in norway, and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children's programs for my 2 daughters.my dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian.rainbow i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone, and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office, especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern.the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies, rentaghost, terrahawks, bod.could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torch.the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no one could approach oliver postgate's wonderful voices.the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90.it's only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn't it i'd hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation i love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic.chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be mega this re gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the .thats the appeal though, it's so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.
