film production 'falls' 40% in uk the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected, screen daily has said.twenty seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly.it attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the national lottery.films with medium budgets of up to 9m, a similar level to box office hits vera drake, calendar girls and enduring love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown.the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production, when bridget jones the edge of reason, wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk.the drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered, the council's spokesperson said.it was too early to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005, the uk film council said.
