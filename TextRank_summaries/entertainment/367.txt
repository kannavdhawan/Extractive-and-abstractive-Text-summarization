us 'afflicted' with awards fatigue the film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema goers and the tv viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies, according to some la film critics.this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock, who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them, calling award shows idiotic .the near constant flow of us film awards, representing directors, actors and producers' guilds, also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us, he said.screen international's us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004's films have simply not grabbed the public's imagination.film makers haven't produced films that people adore this year, he said.mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact, but added i'm all for lower ratings though there are far more important things going on than the oscars.mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but mike goodridge thought rock's humour could prompt america's conservative states to switch off.so despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win clint eastwood's million dollar baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings, mr karger said.and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese's aviator and million dollar baby.mr karger, whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh's abortion drama vera drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments.i hope this is the year for small films to triumph, he said.
