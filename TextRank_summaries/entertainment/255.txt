the four piece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning kasabian places on the best british group, rock act and live act shortlists.british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again, declared kasabian's singer tom meighan.the serpent's going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriter guitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound.we got a computer and we cut rock'n'roll up, because there's no point in going back to how it was, said meighan.kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there.signed to the rca record label, kasabian tested the water with two singles, club foot and lsf, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the uk singles chart respectively.kasabian's self titled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses, primal scream and the happy mondays.we take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it, said pizzorno.this is not a job to us, added meighan.
