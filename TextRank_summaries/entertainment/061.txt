director nair's vanity project indian film director mira nair has said she was thrilled to be given the chance to make william makepeace thackeray's novel vanity fair as the book has been a favourite through her life.the book is one of the classics of english literature the story of scheming 19th century social climber becky sharp, played in the film by reese witherspoon.nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has controversially made in a bollywood style, including two song and dance routines in the film's second half.they offered me their next best thing, not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was 16 years old in an irish catholic boarding school in india.nair's indian style adaptation of vanity fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the us where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week who described the bollywood elements as jarring.the film has a new ending, with becky sharp running off for a new life in india.but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray who was born in india but moved to england as a young man had seen the world.first, when i was 16, it was becky sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because i recognised myself in her i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in, she said.nair also defended her decision to cast an american actress reese witherspoon as becky sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish.thackeray describes becky sharp as a minx.but nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film.she runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses she does everything, nair said.
