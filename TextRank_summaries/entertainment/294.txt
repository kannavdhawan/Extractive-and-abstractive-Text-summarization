no uk premiere for rings musical the producers behind the lord of the rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in london because no suitable theatre was available.the 11.5m show will make its debut in toronto in march 2006, after it was found that all three west end theatres with sufficient capacity were booked.producer kevin wallace said it would be worth waiting for .i know there will be a lot of disappointed british tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in london, but we couldn't get a london theatre in time, added the british producer.the world premiere of the stage musical, co produced by canadian theatrical impresarios david and ed mirvish, will take place at toronto's princess of wales theatre next year.the tolkien books and films are hugely popular in canada, said mr wallace, shortly after signing the deal in canada.the production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale, he said.
