bangkok film festival battles on organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster.the festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund.when the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel, said the festival's executive director, craig prater.our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund, he continued.mr prater's sentiments were echoed by christine rush, director of the festival's sister event, the bangkok film market.we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster, she said.however, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life.we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out, she added.that said, the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.irons, whose film being julia is in competition for the festival's golden kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after december's catastrophe.i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened, the british actor said.now in its third year, bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar.i have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top asian film festival in the world.
