evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim.lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used.the csi effect is basically the perception of the near infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show, said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us.the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000 300,000 backlogged dna samples in us labs.dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions.prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because, for example, they wonder 'why wasn't everything tested ' well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested, dr houck explained.defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut this objective method that's always accurate.my university course started with four graduates in 1999 we're now the largest major on campus with 400 students, he said.
