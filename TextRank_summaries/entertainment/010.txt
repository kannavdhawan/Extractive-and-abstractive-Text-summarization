the ugandan media council said the performance would not be put on as it promoted and glorified acts such as lesbianism and homosexuality.the play promotes illegal, unnatural sexual acts, homosexuality and prostitution, it should be and is hereby banned, the council's ruling said.but the work's author, us playwright eve ensler, says it is all about women's empowerment.there is obviously some fear of the vagina and saying the word vagina, ms ensler told the bbc.she said the play is being produced and performed by ugandan women and it is not being forced on them.i'm extremely outraged at the hypocrisy, the play's organiser in uganda, sarah mukasa, told the bbc's focus on africa programme.
