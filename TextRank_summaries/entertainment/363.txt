in the us the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years.while the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony.the film had taken 500m 264m worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took 1.8bn 952m .when titanic does 1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest.the biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is the aviator, which has taken 90m 48m in the us, although takings in the uk have reached only 7m so far.the year's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the oscar nominees but in the animation category.but many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success.i have never equated the academy awards with how much money a movie takes in, said nikki rocco, head of distribution at universal which released nominee ray.this is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.
