ms berman said i think the audience expects loud things from fox.who's your daddy, the first episode of which was shown on 3 january, pulled in a disappointing audience of 6.3 million, according to the nielsen ratings system.five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from fox's schedules, ms berman said.she was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the network's established reality shows, such as american idol, which is due to start its fourth series this week.though that had met with a poor reception, ms berman said there's no question that the audience, in our mind, is ready, willing and able to accept new programming in the summer .
