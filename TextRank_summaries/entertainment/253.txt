of 2004 list of artists to watch, published at the start of last year.best song of the last 25 years yeah right.i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.best song in 25 years, you must be joking.its good if you like that sort of thing, but really listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work.there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years what about the specials ghost town, the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone.it's musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated, a bit like mr williams himself.this result isn't very surprising though, the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music best of the last 25 years maybe.rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years.how depressing and just when we thought manufactured 'pop' was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn't that good i'm happy for robbie himself though best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels.phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non fans know the words to angels.personally i wanted will young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent i hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no one to slow dance with i agree about angels.i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song.it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush.whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best.yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.booo hisss angels, best song you are kidding, right last five years i might be willing to accept, but 25, no way.what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years i don't think so what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom , should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10 people have such short memories a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years not a chance.i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.no, because i'm not female and i'm not 10 ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song.but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years the shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke predictable and laughable.the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years.the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed.whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.i am a huge robbie fan and love that song.but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song.i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds, the beatles and nick drake have done for music today.the best song of the past 25 years really come on, this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down.it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division.i suppose it's confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull no offence robbie, but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music, and a further nail in the coffin i think robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide.if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble.sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.a sad day for music it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.best song in 25 years since 1980 i'm confused.angels isn't a bad song.granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him best song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner.angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song don't get me wrong, i'm not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.without angels, robbie williams may well not be where he is now, and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists.i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales.the same goes with the scissor sisters, i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near u2's new record, neither are they in the same league.since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard it absolutely deserved to win.it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.
