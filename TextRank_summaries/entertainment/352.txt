vera drake's bafta triumph hope at the bafta film awards on saturday night, there is the prospect that a home grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.empire magazine's reviews editor dan jolin said the film had a very good chance of doing well on saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards.i don't think it's going to do a lord of the rings style sweep, but imelda staunton is a shoo in for best actress, he said.a best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily nominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland.mr jolin tipped another contender most likely the aviator to walk away with the bafta for best film, and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies.if mike leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be vera drake at this year's baftas , said mr jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet.if there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the baftas, he said.the guardian's film critic peter bradshaw felt that there might well be a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night.
