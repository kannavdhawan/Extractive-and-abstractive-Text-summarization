dvd review spider man 2 it's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good.the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects.this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film.sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man.the films look well transferred to dvd, though none has extras.this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilma's erin gray tongue in cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember.that's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.
