music man to the oscars bill conti's job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment.this year marks conti's 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra.the excitement is a live performance as a musician, he says.' the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show.as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.but you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting, explains conti.so when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately, adds conti.the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers.the decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music is relayed from the director's box to the orchestra via conti's earpiece.when the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall.on occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak.julia roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do, he says.conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff.but there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories.conti's most nerve wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke.conti immediately told the show's director i start cursing and screaming, i tell him we're not going to die for this show you must do something or i'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes.no one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time, laughs conti.
