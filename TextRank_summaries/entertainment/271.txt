german music in a 'zombie' state the german music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.tim renner, the head of universal music germany until last year, told bbc world service's the music biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive.renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible.the problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out, he stated.the music market in germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros 1.8bn .however, peter zombic, the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany, said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed.it's quite true that we have severe problems in germany but that's true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too, he argued.i don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact, especially in regard to germany talent, the market is quite successful.mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem.there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it's nice, it's fun, he added.
