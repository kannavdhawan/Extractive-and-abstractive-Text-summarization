oscars steer clear of controversy the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front runners would have had to be michael moore's bush baiting documentary fahrenheit 9 11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ.but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ a film accused of being anti semitic receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious, he said.while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category.hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign language films no one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language, he said.but aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations.but mr dams said it's not an inflammatory film.another 'contentious' film, mr dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.mr dams said it's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well paced.while in fahrenheit 9 11 there are moments of comedy, i think the way that super size me is put together the fact it's a very likeable film means it's won through on charm.
