dj double act revamp chart show dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio 1's flagship chart show on sunday, adding showbiz news, celebrity interviews and between song banter.radio 1's chart show is an institution and remains the station's single most popular show, says jk, also known as jason king.that change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio 1 slot.the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme, says ross.the show's reduced reliance upon the top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles, says 27 year old ross.but it's premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead, ross adds.while sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april.ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday, while king is more of an r b and dance music fan.so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes, says king, 30, who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcaster .the advantage joel and i have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive, king says.
