although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, mr newton said his copyright had been infringed.but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition.a three judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newton's recording.we hold that beastie boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half step over a background c note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newton's copyright, chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion.
