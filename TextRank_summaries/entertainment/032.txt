redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance, which take place during the same week in park city, are competing for sundance's limelight.the point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them.once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came.with them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone, explains redford.people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood, but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film, he adds.international film makers have always been celebrated here, but 2005 is the first year a dedicated world dramatic and documentary competition is being held.redford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the american media fails to reflect, particularly how the us is perceived internationally.it's the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration, he says.while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic.but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience.
