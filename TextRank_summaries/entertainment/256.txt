brits debate over 'urban' music joss stone, a 17 year old soul singer from devon, beat dizzee rascal, jamelia, lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards.the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong.how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing it's so far removed that i don't expect them to get it bang on.i don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated, or by the brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day.if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she's signed to, then so be it.if you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip hop, r b, garage and into that obviously comes soul.joss stone is a soul artist.she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban.if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain, i think that's where you can call it urban that's where this new sub category, or uber category, has come from.joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn't argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine.what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background.if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community, i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too.a type of music especially street music that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.she might not be urban, but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stands for rhythm and blues, remember that joss stone is rubbish is certain.if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop, soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets, although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize, joss stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.if people want to call it urban, why not if we really analysed it, the term 'dance music' is misleading because it doesn't describe everything you can dance to.whilst i agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won.'urban' to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i've been to.good luck to joss stone, let's celebrate her victory let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as jamelia, lemar, kanye west, dizzee rascal, alicia keys and outkast we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making.if lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than joss' work won, he might have said nothing.stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from.joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the usa could sing country music.if that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards.the very term 'music of black origin' has confused and offended many people.it appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable.the term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind.urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe black music that's become popular now.it's just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.look at all the tv broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music.black people should lead the music they invented .the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing, with streets, amy winehouse, etc.. they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos , but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards.her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'urban' banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white.urban is pc version for saying black music.how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof.joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but i don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with robbie williams.urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doesn't that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc.and doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesn't make any sense.urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music.oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they're a white rock band they won't be described as such.joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored.
