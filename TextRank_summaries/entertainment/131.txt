franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians, while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps, at the university of edinburgh event.i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them, he said.kapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotland's role in making 21st century music.kapranos and his glasgow four piece band have been nominated for five prizes at next week's brit awards, including best group and best album.kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music, adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fm.if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.as a scot living in england, i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success, so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand, travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no.yes the government should fund music it brings joy to the masses.there are already thousands of state funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the new deal .as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move.i would hate to see more pop idol type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales if they'd had a government grant to get started they'd have more than paid it back by now, so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out.however, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician.the government shouldn't fund music it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise.i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.yeah, why not music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands artists and stuff.pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities i agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer.there is a great deal of money generated through pop music perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy.though i really like franz ferdinand, i have to disagree with mr kapranos.the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately funded organizations, like save the music in the us.
