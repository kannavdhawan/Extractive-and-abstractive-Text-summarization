asia quake increases poverty risk nearly two million people across asia could be thrown into poverty because of the indian ocean tsunami, the asian development bank adb has said.in its first overview of the disaster, the adb said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage.the move was aimed at helping south asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only sri lanka, indonesia and the seychelles have indicated that they will take it up.the adb fears that 1 million indonesians could join them, while in india just over half a million people 645,000 are at risk of falling into poverty.a quarter of a million sri lankans and 23,500 people in the maldives are also facing poverty.sri lanka and the maldives are the two countries the adb fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami.a government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the adb, world bank and japanese aid agencies on wednesday, and promised to publish the plan within 10 days.indonesia, malaysia, thailand and india have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs.but the economies of the affected countries except sri lanka and the maldives should emerge with minimal damage, the adb report said.thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while india has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources.
