fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.the argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy, thomas dawson, an imf director, said earlier this month.argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors.the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions.pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country's massive debts.three years ago, every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis, said entrepreneur drayton valentine.agriculture and tourism are helping, said entrepreneur drayton valentine.mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, was fortunate at the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad.locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now, he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re opening.argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001.president nestor kirchner's administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts' nominal value standing at around 100bn it is not proving easy.everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached, he said.with the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina, said carlos baez silva, president of aara, an association that represents bank account and bond holders.few people have recovered more than about half their savings, mr baez silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe.the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments.mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, agreed.if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem, but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank .
