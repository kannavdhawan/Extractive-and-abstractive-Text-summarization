the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill.group menatep, the gibraltar based holding company which controls 51% of yukos, says this was illegal.the russian government's argument for selling yuganskneftegaz the unit's full name was that yukos owed more than 27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments.we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation, said tim osborne, a director of group menatep.menatep said the value of its yukos shareholding had gone from 17.8bn to virtually nothing since 2003 as a result of the russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%.while russia has signed the charter, it has never ratified it which some experts say could make it difficult for menatep to press its case.mr khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of menatep.
