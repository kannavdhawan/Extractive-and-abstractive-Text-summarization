the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market.the wto itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry.some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people.the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market.the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh, cambodia, sri lanka and nepal, andrew pendleton, christian aid's head of trade policy, said.the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should put the interests of poor people first rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost .while the current mfa was not perfect, its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, christian aid said.
