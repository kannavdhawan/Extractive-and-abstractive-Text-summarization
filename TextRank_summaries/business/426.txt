minister hits out at yukos sale russia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned.economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was unjustified .his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership.on 28 december, another senior economic adviser called the sale the swindle of the century .yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of yukos' output, had been seized and sold in december for less than 10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state owned company, must be privatized, he said.mr gref also poured cold water on president putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade.the task is not simply to double gdp instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people's lives, mr gref told kommersant.
