speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai, he said a full listing was one of the options for funding after the club moves to its new stadium.the club which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange is due to move into its new 60,000 seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 2006 07 season.mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time.the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money earning means, including a full share listing.when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review, mr dein said.mr dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown.since the formation of the premier league in season 1992 93, premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar.
