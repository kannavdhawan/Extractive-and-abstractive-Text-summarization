bt offers equal access to rivals bt has moved to pre empt a possible break up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.the move comes after telecom regulator ofcom said in november that the firm must offer competitors real equality of access to its phone lines .ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the uk telecom sector.central to the proposals are plans by bt to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly regulated access to bt's local network, the former monopoly said in a statement.the group is to set up a new access services division with a separate board which would include independent members to ensure equal access for rivals to the local loop , the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households.the company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from april in areas of high customer demand.the scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider, chief executive lee strafford said.aol backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field.this is a reminder to ofcom that as long as bt can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the uk's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile, a spokesman said.ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service ipstream and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.more than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.
