us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all time high of 671.7bn 484bn in 2004, latest figures show.the commerce department said the trade deficit for all of last year was 24.4% above the previous record 2003's imbalance of 496.5bn.the us consumer's appetite for all things from oil to imported cars, and even wine and cheese, reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush's economic policies.meanwhile, the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world, spurring on more demand for imported goods.but others point out that the deficit has reached such astronomical proportions that foreigners many choose not to hold as many dollar denominated assets, which may in turn harm growth.
