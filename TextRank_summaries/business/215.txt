sec to rethink post enron rules the us stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes oxley act.it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the securities and exchange commission sec would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements .but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements.he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act's least popular measure section 404 for foreign firms.seen as particularly costly to implement, section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts.the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms including us ones with market capitalisations below 700m 374m .
