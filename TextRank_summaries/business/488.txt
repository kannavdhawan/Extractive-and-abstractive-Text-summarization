the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further 100bn in the red.past congressional budget office cbo forecasts said there would be a 348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year.the budget deficit hit a record 412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004, after reaching 377bn in the previous fiscal year.the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of 855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections.republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan.but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies.
