yukos sues four firms for 20bn russian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas.the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom, its unit gazpromneft, investment company baikal, and state oil firm rosneft.as well as suing for damages, yukos has asked the us court to send its tax dispute with the russian government to an international arbitrator.the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however.concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and yuganskneftegas was sold to little known investment firm baikal finance group.a few days later, baikal gave control of the company to state run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn.rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with gazprom, bringing a large chunk of russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.
