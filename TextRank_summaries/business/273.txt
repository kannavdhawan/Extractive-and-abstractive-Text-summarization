markets fall on weak dollar fears rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from fed chief alan greenspan.g20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in japan and europe.and mr greenspan warned asian states could soon stop funding the us deficit.together with a 500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across america's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower.but he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar.at present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency.similarly, asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account the deficit between what the us as a whole spends and what it earns.and mr greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments.it seems persuasive that, given the size of the us current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point, he said.
