in a welcome economic boost for newly re elected president george w bush, the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains.the 337,000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169,000 figure that wall street economists had forecast.in addition, the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months to 139,000 in september instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in august instead of 128,000.other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week.kathleen utgoff, commissioner of the bureau of labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean up work in florida, and neighbouring deep south states, following four hurricanes in august and september.
