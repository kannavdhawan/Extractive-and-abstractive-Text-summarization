the kremlin said on tuesday that the 6bn which russian state bank veb lent state owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks.the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long term oil supply deal with china.according to russian newspaper vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk.reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long term oil supply deal instead.analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos, yugansk's former owner, if cnpc had become a shareholder.the two companies rosneft and cnpc have agreed on the pre payment for long term deliveries, said russian oil official sergei oganesyan.yugansk was sold for 9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a 27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china's desire to secure long term oil supplies to feed its booming economy.
