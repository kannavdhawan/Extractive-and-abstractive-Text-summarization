formerly one of mr brown's closest treasury aides, ed balls hinted at a budget giveaway on 16 march.any rate rise ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party's chances of winning, he added.gordon brown's decision to announce the date of the budget while on a trip to china was a sensible thing to do , since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, mr balls told the bbc.commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the bank of england's monetary policy committee mpc to factor a potential election into its rate decisions.i don't believe it would be a big election issue in britain or a problem for labour, mr balls said.
