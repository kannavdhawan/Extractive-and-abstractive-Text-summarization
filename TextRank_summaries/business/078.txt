the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000.gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit.but gianni agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred gm's offer to buy a 20% stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a put option .since then, however, fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gm's stake in half to 10%.
