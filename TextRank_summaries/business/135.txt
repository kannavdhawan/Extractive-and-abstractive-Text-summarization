the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name.the commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.from 2007 onwards, greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products.the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years.denmark is europe's second largest producer of feta after greece producing about 30,000 tonnes a year and exports its products to greece.it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation, mr kristiansen said.the case will also have a major impact on britain's sole feta producer, yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses.the original decision was a victory for greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years.
