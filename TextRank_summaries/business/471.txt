tsunami slows sri lanka's growth sri lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth 3.5bn 1.8bn by appealing for peace and national unity.president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict.meanwhile, the international monetary fund imf said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka's economic growth this year.separately, the international labour organisation ilo said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone.the imf said that the sri lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at 1.3 to 1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this.growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs.the ilo estimated that 400,000 sri lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries.economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast.although major exports have not suffered, the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments.foreign exchange reserves may become strained as sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre tsunami level which totalled more than two months worth of imports.
