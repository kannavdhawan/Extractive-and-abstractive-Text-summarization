mci shareholder sues to stop bid a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a 6.75bn 3.6bn buyout by telecoms giant verizon, hoping to get a better deal.the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications, which had an earlier offer for mci rejected, said it would submit an improved bid.qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth 8bn.a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company.friday's lawsuit argues that the verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the us phone industry will put a premium on mci's network, assets and clients.a takeover of mci would be the fifth billion dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
