indian oil firm eyes yukos assets india's biggest oil exploration firm, oil natural gas corp ongc , says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos.we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia, said ongc chairman subir raha.local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos' former key oil production unit for 2bn 1bn .state owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand alone firm.indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongc's plans during a trip to moscow last year, and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putin's recent visit to new delhi.india's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies.india produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day bpd , little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts douglas westwood.for countries to develop, they have to have access to energy, said john westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts douglas westwood.by buying into yugansk, ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports, mr westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim.ongc, which is majority owned by the indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam, sudan and russia.should that happen, yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.
