borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25%.we are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher, said ken kim, an analyst at stone mccarthy research.with the economic picture now looking more rosy, the fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in june, august, september and november.although the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to september, analysts warn that fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails.i think the fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility, said david berson, chief economist at fannie mae.but if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly, i think the fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well.
