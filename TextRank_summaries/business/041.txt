speaking to the house budget committee he urged congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes.the government program faces severe financial strains in coming decades as the massive baby boom generation retires.i fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver.he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon to retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford.meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added.he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red.
