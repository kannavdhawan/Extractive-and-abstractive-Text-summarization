the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble.and its owner, p o cruises now part of the huge us carnival corporation was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco.why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time, says deutsche bank's simon champion.but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one off events.despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003.similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited.moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets no matter what happens to the ill fated aurora in the future.
