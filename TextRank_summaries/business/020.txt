call centre users 'lose patience' customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year.customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society, says cara diemont of it firm dimension data, which commissioned the survey.however, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait.one possible reason for the lack in patience, ms diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.in what dimension data calls an alarming development , the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving agents not equipped to deal with customers .as a result, call centres have a high churn rate , with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff.resolution rates the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction are running at just 50%.suggestions that outsourcing relocating call centres to low cost countries like india or south africa is to blame are wrong, ms diemont says.
