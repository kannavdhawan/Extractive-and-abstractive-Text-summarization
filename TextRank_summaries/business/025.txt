yukos filed for chapter 11 protection in houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its yugansk division by the russian authorities.the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk, which yukos claims was illegally sold.texas judge letitia clark said yukos did not have enough of a us presence to establish us jurisdiction.the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia, judge clark said in her ruling.yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston.yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums russian courts and the european court of human rights were either unfriendly or offered less protection.in her ruling, the judge acknowledged that it appears likely that agencies of the russian government have acted in a manner that would be considered confiscatory under united states law .the us court's jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft, a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft.yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling.
