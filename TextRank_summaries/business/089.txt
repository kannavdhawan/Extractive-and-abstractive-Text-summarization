europe blames us over weak dollar european leaders have openly blamed the us for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.us officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words.meeting in brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports.the european ministers' comments, said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo, were generally too weak to produce a market reaction .nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europe's economies by eating into their exports.we are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends, he said.the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was in america's interest .i fully welcome the words of mr snow, said joaquin almunia, but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction.
