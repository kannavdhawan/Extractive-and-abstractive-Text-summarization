bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn 230bn this year.the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra 80bn from congress later this year.yet mr bush's proposed spending of 3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of 5bn.a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at agriculture and 5.6% at the environmental protection agency.the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to 2.18 trillion.in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government, mr bush said in his budget message to congress.mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years.the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower.and the figures also rely on the social security trust fund the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions being offset against the main budget deficit.
