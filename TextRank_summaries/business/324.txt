yukos seeks court action on sale yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group, the little known firm which has bought its main asset.russian newspapers have claimed that baikal which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for 9.4bn 261bn roubles, 4.8bn on sunday at a state provoked auction has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth biggest oil producer.many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.the russian government forced the sale of yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a 27bn back tax bill it says the company owes.yukos' us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction.yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company.
