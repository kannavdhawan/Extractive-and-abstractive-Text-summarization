the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam.the fed's open market committee which sets interest rate policy in the us voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise.the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in june, august and september.the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a measured pace.in a statement, the fed said that long term inflation pressures remained well contained while the us economy appeared to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices .us firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in september.analysts claimed the fed's assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in december.let's wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter's energy price drag before concluding that the fed has more work to do in 2005, said avery shenfeld, senior economist at cibc world markets.in a report published on wednesday, the bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years.
