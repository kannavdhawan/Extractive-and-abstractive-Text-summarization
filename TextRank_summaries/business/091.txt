russia gets investment blessing soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says.russia's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos.but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past.instead, with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, s p said the government's own debt is looking a good bet.these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia, wrote s p credit analyst helena hessel.the yukos saga is the most high profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes.
