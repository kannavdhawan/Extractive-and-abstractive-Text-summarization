yukos bankruptcy 'not us matter' russian authorities do not have to abide by any us court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant yukos, a houston court has been told.yukos says a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold, since it has a us subsidiary and local bank accounts.yukos made its surprise chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in houston in december in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of yugansk, its main oil producing unit, by russian authorities.the us court's jurisdiction has been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft, a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft.deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos.the company is also seeking 20bn in a separate us lawsuit against rosneft and gazprom for their role in the sale of yugansk.
