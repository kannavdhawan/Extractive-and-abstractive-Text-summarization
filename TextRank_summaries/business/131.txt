russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include yugansk, which was controversially bought last year.the merger, backed by russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in gazprom shares.gazprom chief alexei miller confirmed rosneft owned yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of gazprom in exchange for rosneft.the state wanted to control gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade.speaking on ntv television, which is controlled by gazprom, mr miller added that yugansk, which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov.obtaining majority control over gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in gazprom shares, mr miller added.by opening up trading in gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders.analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8% of russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk.
