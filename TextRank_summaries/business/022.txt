sluggish economy hits german jobs the number of people out of work in europe's largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow.german unemployment rose 7,000 in november to 4.464 million people, or 10.8% of the workforce.the seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect.but officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market.with unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of chancellor gerhard schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda.job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.
