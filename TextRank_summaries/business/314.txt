baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom, the state controlled gas monopoly, to buy yuganskneftegas.baikal paid 260.75bn roubles 9.37bn 4.8bn for yugansk nowhere near the 27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes.yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law, and said baikal had bought itself trouble.meanwhile, tim osborne, head of yukos main shareholders' group menatep, said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside russia, against the auction winners.reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly 1.7bn from a sberbank savings bank account to the russian federal property fund, for yugansk.yukos has always insisted the auction was state sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes.but just two companies turned up for the auction, gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group, named after a large freshwater lake in siberia.and, according to tass news agency, gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom.i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and gazprom is then recognised as the winner.the protection, if recognised by the russian authorities, would have allowed yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets.hours before the auction lawyers for menatep, a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries.menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.
