as part of a charm offensive ahead of 17 december, when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements.the point of all this has been to convince europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu, allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.if admitted into the eu, turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn 6bn to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's state planning organisation.as turkey's gross domestic output gdp is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020.a literate and qualified turkish population, insisted mr sener, will make a positive impact on the eu.however, turkey's assertions are confirmed by brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy.costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros.more recently, less palatable concerns at least in liberal european circles have been voiced, with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a river of islam , an oriental culture and a threat to europe's cultural richness .critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey's economic roadmap has been over egged an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to 10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.the country's massive debt which includes 23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu.in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product, says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department.at about 80% of gdp, turkey's gross debt is double that figure.turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession.there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable, says michael deppler, director of the imf's european department.a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria.and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.
