oil prices reach three month low oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.the falls were triggered when the energy information administration eia said on wednesday that us crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.analysts also attributed the fall to mild early winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.the stronger fuel inventories helped boost us stock markets to nine month highs on wednesday, though only the nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of thursday.the long awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth.however, traders warned that the fall could be short lived if there is a cold snap in north america this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.opec nations have increased production to 25 year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild us stocks hit by supply disruptions after hurricane ivan in september.however, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec's attitude to over production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.a cold spell in north america would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises.analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.
