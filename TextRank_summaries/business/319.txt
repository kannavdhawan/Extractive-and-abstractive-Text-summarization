euronext joins bid battle for lse pan european stock market euronext has approached the london stock exchange lse about a possible takeover bid.talks with the european stock market and with rival bidder deutsche boerse will continue, the lse said.commentators say that a deal with euronext, which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse.a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse's offer.because we already own liffe in london, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse, the newspaper quoted the executive as saying.
