an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation, the authors say.the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year.after mr putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police.but shareholders benefited hugely sibneft started to pay dividends 53m in 2000 and almost 1bn in 2001 and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds.according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.for a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly defined motivation companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue.genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.the case against yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed.since yukos' founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the russian market has dropped by 10% an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.
