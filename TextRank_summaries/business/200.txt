cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba's ailing economy.cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in cuba, will be affected.critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise.in a live television broadcast announcing the measure, president castro's chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states' increasing economic aggression .the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country, he said.cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home.their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate.the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year, particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.the tax is designed to provide much needed revenue for cuba's cash strapped economy.the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, mr barrionuevo said.
