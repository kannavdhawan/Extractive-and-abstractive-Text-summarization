us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than 60bn 31.7bn , an all time record.figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 2.3% to 95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to 155.8bn on rising consumer demand.but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar which makes exports less expensive has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.by 1650 gmt, the dollar was trading against the euro at 1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement.although the white house officially still backs the us's traditional strong dollar policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued.the trade deficit is a large part of the latter.in november, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food.although china's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to chinese government figures, the commerce department revealed the us's deficit with china was 19.6bn in november, down from 19.7bn the month before.
