saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium sized cadillac bls at its loss making saab factory in sweden.as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine.neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market.for years, saab has consistently said it is competing head on with bmw, mercedes and jaguar.gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers.bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and saab is losing money fast albeit with losses halved in 2004 to 200m 104m 151m euros from 500m the previous year.beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations, gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs, opels badged as vauxhalls in the uk and now cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts.another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car.we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today, the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news.in a separate announcement, gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models.
