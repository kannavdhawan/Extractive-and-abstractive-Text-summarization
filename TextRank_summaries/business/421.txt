lse 'sets date for takeover deal' the london stock exchange lse is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim.both deutsche boerse and rival euronext held talks with the london market last week over a possible offer.a 1.3bn offer from deutsche boerse has already been rejected, while euronext has said it will make an all cash bid.however, the sunday telegraph report added that there are signs that deutsche boerse chief executive werner seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the lse's managed bid process.the newspaper also claimed mr seifert was becoming increasingly frustrated with the pace of negotiations since deutsche boerse's 1.3bn offer was rejected in mid december, in particular the lse's decision to suspend talks over the christmas period.others claim it will weaken the city's status as europe's financial centre, while german politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to london if a bid is successful.
