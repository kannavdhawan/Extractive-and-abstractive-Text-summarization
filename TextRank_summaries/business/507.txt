the ons says gross domestic product gdp rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 december, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter.the ons said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three quarters of the uk economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter.the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period.the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend growth and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown, said ross walker, uk economist at rbs financial markets.however, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession.but steve radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation eef, said these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground.the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.simon rubinsohn, chief economist at gerrard, said this outturn of 0.7% was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy.
