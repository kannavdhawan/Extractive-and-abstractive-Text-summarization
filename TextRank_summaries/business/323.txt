cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell.data from the cml showed lending fell to just over 25bn in november, from 25.5bn a year earlier.separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals loans agreed but not yet made stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally adjusted 2.98bn.miles shipside, commercial director at rightmove, said sellers would have to be more realistic with their asking prices to tempt buyers.the average asking price of a home fell by more than 600 from 190,329 in november to 189,733 in december, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole, cml director general michael coogan said.it's a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market, investec economist philip shaw said.
