air passengers win new eu rights air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines.the european commission is facing two legal challenges one from the european low fare airlines association elaa and the other from the international air transport association iata , which has attacked the package as a bad piece of legislation .the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.in addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.however, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to extraordinary circumstances .all eu based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday.andy clarke, eraa director of air transport, said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added.the eraa's mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers.the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.
