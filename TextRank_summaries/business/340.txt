venezuela and china sign oil deal venezuelan president hugo chavez has offered china wide ranging access to the country's oil reserves.the offer, made as part of a trade deal between the two countries, will allow china to operate oil fields in venezuela and invest in new refineries.china's quick growing economy's need for oil has contributed to record high oil prices this year, along with political unrest in the middle east and supply bottlenecks.a lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the middle east has meant that china is looking to invest in other potential markets such as latin america.chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of venezuela, which could produce more than one billion barrels, he confirmed.mr chavez has also invited chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western gulf of venezuela.
