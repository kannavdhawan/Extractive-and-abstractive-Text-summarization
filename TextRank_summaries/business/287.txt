japan's ageing workforce built to last in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties.and the 101 year old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.at his neat osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony.women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than americans and europeans.by 2007, japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century.this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.in the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population, explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo.the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%.but unfortunately, japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically.glen wood, vice president of deutsche securities japan, asks who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward one option is further welfare reform.in japan, as in europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject.but for the japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.in contrast to japan and of course the european union the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century.japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession.come 2020, japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power.there are fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession.
