us regulator to rule on pain drug us food and drug regulators will decide on friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but merck said it would consider selling it if it gets fda approval.alarm bells were rung by a research note called approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months.the cox 2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including merck and pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us, mr kim explained.on thursday, david graham from the fda's office of drug safety told the advisory panel that there really doesn't appear to be a need for cox 2 inhibitors.european regulators, meanwhile, ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox 2 inhibitors.the european medicines agency also said doctors should be cautious about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.
