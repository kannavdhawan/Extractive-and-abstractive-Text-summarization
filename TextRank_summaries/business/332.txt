putin backs state grab for yukos russia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state owned company to ensure its interests were met.rosneft bought 100% of baikal finance group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia's booming oil industry.everything was done by market methods, mr putin said at his year end press conference in moscow.the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos, one of russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse.the russian government put yukos's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a 27bn 14bn bill for back taxes and fines.analysts say that yukos's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week's cloak and dagger dealings.gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction.by selling the yukos unit to little known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said.the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday's auction.lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos with an office in houston had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction.
