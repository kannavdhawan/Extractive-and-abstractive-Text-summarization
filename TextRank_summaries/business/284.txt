iraqi voters turn to economic issues beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters.first rule of law, then the economy, says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003.the economy has become the second most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post war iraq.job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people's wish list.an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles.hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector.but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes ms alexander.in the west, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare.opinion polls suggest that people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things , ms alexander says.yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago.i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast, mr hadi says.blackwatch's baghdad based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out.life goes on in iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.
