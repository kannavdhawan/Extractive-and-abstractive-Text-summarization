under new european age discrimination rules, a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced.workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age, although employers will have the right to refuse.trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age.under age discrimination proposals from the department of trade and industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.this makes a mockery of the government's so called commitment to outlawing ageism, leaving the incoming age discrimination law to unravel, said gordon lishman, director general of age concern england .the decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said.
