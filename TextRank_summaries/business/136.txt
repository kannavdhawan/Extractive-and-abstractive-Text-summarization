ukraine revisits state sell offs ukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.the new president, viktor yushchenko, has said a limited list of companies is being drawn up.but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms.the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock bottom prices.ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.a day earlier, mr yushchenko keen to reassure potential investors had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted.an open ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in ukraine, said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit.but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia, mr hensel said.the privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk, mr kuchma's son in law, for 800m 424m despite higher bids from several foreign groups.we say krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state, mr yushchenko told an investors' conference in kiev.
