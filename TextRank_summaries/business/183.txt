business fears over sluggish eu economy as european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home namely how to stay in business.it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days.director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india.they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes, he says.which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here.its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed, but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home.in the us growth is something like 6%, in china they are estimating 15%, and in the eu it is more or less 1%, he says.in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment.with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem.if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be.but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china.the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says helmut schneider, director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university.labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half, he says.
