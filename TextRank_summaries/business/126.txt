barclays' chief john varley said the bank had caught the winds of a very strong world economy.earnings at barclays capital investment bank rose 25% to 1.04bn, but investment in branch operations held back growth in its uk retail business.according to analysts' forecasts, hsbc, the biggest uk bank by stock market valuation, will report profits of 9.4bn later this month.profits at barclaycard rose by 5% to 801m but were said to have been affected by a series of interest rate rises and investment to grow its customer base.the bank also blamed margins pressure on its mortgage business and spending on its branches over the past year for a 1% fall in profits in its uk retail division to 1.13bn.speaking on bbc radio 4, mr varley declined to be drawn on reports that barclays had held merger talks with us bank wells fargo.a tie up between barclays and california based wells fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at 180bn.
