us industrial output growth eases us industrial production continued to rise in november, albeit at a slower pace than the previous month.the us federal reserve said output from factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3% in line with forecasts from a revised 0.6% increase in october.the us economy grew at a respectable annual rate of 3.7% in the three months between july and september, while jobs growth averaged 178,000 during the same period.a breakdown of the latest production figures shows mining output drove the increase, surging 2.1%, while factory output rose 0.3%.so there is still a lot of inflation fighting slack in the manufacturing sector, overall i'd say manufacturing at least away from autos continues to improve and i would bet that it improves at a faster rate in coming months given how lean inventories are, citigroup senior economist steven wieting added.
