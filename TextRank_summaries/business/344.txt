battered dollar hits another low the dollar has fallen to a new record low against the euro after data fuelled fresh concerns about the us economy.ministers from european and asian governments have recently called on the us to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export driven economies.thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year on year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12% in november with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.the official us policy is that it supports a strong dollar but many market observers believe it is happy to let the dollar fall because of the boost to its exporters.the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005.i can see it finishing the year around 1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro dollar in 2005, finishing the year around 1.40, said adrian hughes, currency strategist with hsbc in london.
