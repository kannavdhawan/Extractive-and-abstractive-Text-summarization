earlier this month, mr glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club.in a statement, the club said it would allow mr glazer limited due diligence to give him the opportunity to take the proposal on to a formal bid.but it said it continued to oppose mr glazer's plans, calling his assumptions aggressive and his plan damaging .many of manchester united's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan based group shareholders united is strongly opposed to any takeover by mr glazer.any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal, the club said in its statement.the board continues to believe that mr glazer's business plan assumptions are aggressive, the statement said, and the direct and indirect financial strain on the business could be damaging.whether or not the bid is attractive in monetary terms, in the case of manchester united many investors hold the stock for sentimental rather than financial reasons.at present, mr glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them manchester united's second biggest shareholders.if the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club's biggest shareholders.a spokesman said the department did not believe there was a case for changing the enterprise act so that takeovers of football clubs could be looked at on non competition grounds.
