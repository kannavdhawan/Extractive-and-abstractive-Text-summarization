world leaders gather to face uncertainty more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum wef .uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos.the organisers of the brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit.however, many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well.ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues from outsourcing to corporate leadership with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme.the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes shimon peres.microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either.having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria, mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases.
