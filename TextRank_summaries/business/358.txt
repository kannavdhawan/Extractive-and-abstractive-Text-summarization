in a court filing on tuesday, it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas based finance chief.deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset.deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because us chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the kremlin's auction of yuganskneftegas on 19 december illegal under us law.deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 december auction of its top unit by the russian government, which was in a tax dispute with yukos.this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case, deutsche bank said in its court filing.yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection, and we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again, he said.in its filing, deutsche bank said houston was a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens .
