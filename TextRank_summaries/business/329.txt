house prices drop as sales slow house prices fell further in november and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the royal institute of chartered surveyors found.a total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to november the highest level in 12 years.the slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one, rics housing spokesman ian perry said.the figures were published as another survey by property website rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than 600 from 190,329 in november to 189,733 in december.but the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels.
