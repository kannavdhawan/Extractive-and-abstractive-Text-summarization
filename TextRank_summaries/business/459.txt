in its quarterly economic review, deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.deloitte's chief economic advisor roger bootle said the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown.whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, deloitte believes.it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006.
