wembley firm won't make a profit shares in multiplex group, which is building the new wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.the australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn australian dollars 458m 874m rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work.increased costs at wembley and a separate development in london's docklands saw multiplex's construction division report profits of a 35.1m.the firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its uk projects which also include the white city redevelopment scheme in west london were performing strongly.to recoup any profit from wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors.multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position, it said.
