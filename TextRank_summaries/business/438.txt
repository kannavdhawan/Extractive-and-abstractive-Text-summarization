rates went up five times from november 2003 as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt but have remained unchanged since august.rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium.cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had slowed in recent months in response to rate rises but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer.the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over abrupt slowdown in consumer activity, he said.the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november, matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise.it also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.so far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing, said eef chief economist, steve radley.some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens.
