bmw cash to fuel mini production less than four years after the new mini was launched, german car maker bmw has announced 100m of new investment.before wednesday's announcement, bmw had invested some 280m in mini production.last year, almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini.our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away, said norbert reithofer, a member of the bmw management board.initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again.the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to 15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list.a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least 8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from 12,556, according to the car buying website parker's.bmw's mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for 10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium.last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 mini workers.the mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 rover cars.indeed, mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford are taken into account.
