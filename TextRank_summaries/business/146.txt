why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world's leading economy by 2010.mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.lisbon risks becoming a synonym for missed objectives and failed promises , his report said.the report comes at a time when europe's competitive position is waning.but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far.the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so called knowledge based economy .but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago.targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the wim report.lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing, the kok report said.that's why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.on one point mr kok was very clear the european union should not try to emulate the us economy.the european economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.it's very ambitious, said john palmer, political director at the european policy centre, a brussels based think tank.but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality.it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission, jose manuel barroso, to adopt mr kok's recommendations and press them on eu governments.he expects his five year term in office to be judged on europe's success in meeting the lisbon agenda.
