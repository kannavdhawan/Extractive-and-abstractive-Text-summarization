but the outlook was worst for the 12 member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the oecd said.overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the oecd, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006.there are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not too distant future, said jean philippe cotis, the oecd's chief economist.if the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters, vincent koen, a senior economist with the oecd, told the bbc's world business report.the recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.china's booming economy and a spectacular comeback in japan albeit one that has faltered in recent months would help world economic recovery, the oecd said.
