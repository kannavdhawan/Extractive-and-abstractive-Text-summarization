the england defender lashed home a 25 yard shot for his first goal in 16 months to take arsenal back into second spot, five points behind chelsea.but before campbell scored the best two chances of the game fell to pompey striker ricardo fuller.a mistake by arjan de zeeuw let thierry henry in behind the pompey defence on 17 minutes but as he bore down on goal linvoy primus got in a saving tackle.but a delightful touch by robin van persie gave henry a sight of goal, although the angle was too tight for his shot to trouble jamie ashdown.ashdown caused hearts to flutter on 28 minutes when he missed his punch at a corner and kolo toure headed just wide and, as arsenal began to press, van persie blasted over a good opportunity after henry had set him up.henry took a quick return pass from vieira but ashdown was out quickly to block, and there were some anxious seconds for pompey as the ball ran loose before matthew taylor cleared.referee howard webb played a good advantage to allow steve stone to send gary o'neil away but, having shrugged off toure, the pompey midfielder planted his shot wide from 10 yards.fuller was given the best chance of the match so far on 48 minutes when patrik berger's break and slipped pass played him clear.but it needed alert reflexes and safe handling from ashdown to cling on to van persie's shot as henry sniffed for scraps.arsenal might have stretched their lead two minutes later when mathieu flamini escaped his marker to flash a header wide from henry's free kick.ashdown, griffin, de zeeuw, primus, taylor, stone, o'neil, faye berkovic 83 , berger, lualua, fuller yakubu 55 .almunia, lauren, toure, campbell, cole, pires, flamini, vieira, clichy, van persie bergkamp 68 , henry.
