england coach andy robinson, who names his team on wednesday, has called up bath prop duncan bell following phil vickery's broken arm.i thought i'd burned all my bridges with england when i expressed an interest in wanting to play for wales, so it's fantastic to get this opportunity, he said.bell, who featured in the england a side which beat france 30 20 10 days ago, added i recognise that i got into the england a squad because of injuries.england coach andy robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced sale sharks prop andrew sheridan into his front row.but sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped bell who was among the try scorers when england a beat france a 30 20 nine days ago to be drafted in.
