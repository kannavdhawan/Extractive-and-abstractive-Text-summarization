parry puts gerrard 'above money' listen to the full interview on sport on five and the bbc sport website from 1900 gmt.but parry, speaking exclusively to bbc sport, also admits gerrard, who has been constantly linked with chelsea, will have the final say on his future.he told bbc five live steven is above money.but we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep steven against his will.on the subject of liverpool's finances, parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan.there have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at anfield and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager rafael benitez and managing to hold on to steven gerrard.on the subject of liverpool's captain and prize asset, parry revealed real madrid did ask for an option on the england midfield man during negotiations for striker fernando morientes.he said they were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for fernando morientes, but the response to real madrid was the same steven is not for sale.but when asked if gerrard would be a liverpool player on the first day of next season, parry said i sincerely hope he will be.steven knows my views.i think steven would dearly love to win things with liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else.it is expected chelsea will test liverpool with a 30m plus bid in the summer but parry claims he will be in no mood to listen.we didn't had an offer last summer, parry explained.we had told chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him.that just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda.parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007.and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought.he said i have to say historically it is something i have been against, and i have been on record as saying that, but i think the size of the arsenal deal is a real eye opener.some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team.on the subject of possible new investment, parry revealed liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the middle east.he also accused liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids, but parry explained steve has never been used as a stalking horse.i think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen.his enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold the door isn't closed on anything.as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do.critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard.parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.
