it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton's win in the 60m hurdles.running sub eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal.diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah.and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head to head race will give sarah confidence.in fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid.he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him but then phillips always has.a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance.she picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that.in the women's race, jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka.the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her.findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain.he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent.
