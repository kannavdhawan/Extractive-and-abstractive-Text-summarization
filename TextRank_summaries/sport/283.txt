tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right, said jol after the 0 0 draw.manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology.i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game, ferguson told mutv.but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.i think you could start off by using it for goal line decisions.arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford, that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence, said wenger.it's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.
