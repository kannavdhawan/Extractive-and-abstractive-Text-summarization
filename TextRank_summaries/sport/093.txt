he says so himself in a matter of fact way as he recalls the car accident which occurred nine days before he was scheduled to step out into the olympic stadium in athens for the 50k walk.i was in a lot of pain and i guessed that one of my toes was broken, says the waterford man.in my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i'd be able to race.it took over 10 hours before jamie knew with certainty that he would not be competing in his second olympics.jamie didn't finally arrive at hospital in athens until some nine and a half hours after the accident.doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about.jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.he then progressed to crutches for six weeks until he was finally able to walk unaided on 10 january.walking without the crutches seemed like something finally really measurable in terms of my recovery.physio sessions with johnston mcevoy in limerick have been a vital part of his recovery.a two and a half inch needle went in yesterday and i'm fairly incapacitated today as a result.jamie heads to poland again on sunday where he will be having daily cryotherapy in addition to twice daily physio sessions and pool work.all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006.there's a lot of work involved in my recovery.i'm doing about six hours a day between physio and pool work.hopefully, after four or five months my back won't tighten up as much.
