ireland win eclipses refereeing 'errors' the international rugby board may have to step in to stop frustrated coaches and players from publicly haranguing referees when things go belly up.the game was as exciting as it comes, with a much improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way.there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19 13 victory, but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport's blazers .as far as england were concerned, there were queries over mark cueto's first half effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick.on that occasion, david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out.however, one has to credit ireland flanker johnny o'connor for cleverly scooping the ball away and blocking any evidence of a touchdown.the referee also missed england's danny grewcock taking out ronan o'gara off the ball to allow martin corry a sunday stroll to the line.brian o'driscoll's winning try was as well conceived as they come, while charlie hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight.and ronan o'gara's tremendous ability to control the game was also a crucial component.two outstanding pieces of defensive play denied england and allowed ireland to hold on.he gobbled up cueto from another hodgson cross field kick, then regained his feet to stop lewsey from scoring a certain try.england had turned ireland one way then the other, and the defence cordon was slowly disintegrating.that spoke volumes about ireland's back foot display, with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end.to win a game like that showed that ireland have moved forward.
