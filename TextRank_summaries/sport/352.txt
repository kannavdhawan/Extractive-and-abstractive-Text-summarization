for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far, wood added.ireland's last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff a fixture they have not lost since 1983.but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting, wood believes wales might end their four match losing run against england in cardiff.so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff, wood added.wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.
