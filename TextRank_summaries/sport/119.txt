time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players.some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end.i would say it's 50 50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so.but international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing.the more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like world cup quarter finals against brazil.often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half.one manager who has got it right this week is walter smith.the new scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing berti vogts.the players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next world cup qualifiers.
