newcastle 2 1 bolton kieron dyer smashed home the winner to end bolton's 10 game unbeaten run.lee bowyer put newcastle ahead when he fed stephen carr on the right flank, then sprinted into the area to power home a header from the resultant cross.but dyer had the last word in a game of few chances, pouncing on a loose ball after alan shearer's shot was blocked and firing into the top corner.bolton keeper jussi jaaskelainen had to make two saves in quick succession midway through the first half keeping out shearer's low shot and dyer's close range header but that was the only goalmouth action of note.bowyer found space with a neat turn on the half way line and striding forward picked out carr to his right.the magpies were opened up again before half time as davies set giannakopoulos in space and given had to block at his near post.bolton were creating little going forward and they seemed content to frustrate the magpies.alan shearer's snap shot was charged down and dyer reacted first to smash the ball past the despairing jaaskelainen from six yards.bolton boss sam allardyce i am bitterly disappointed with the result, but i am probably more disappointed with the second half performance.in the first half we had put them under a lot of pressure, and our goal matched theirs in quality.i thought it would lift us and that they might be tired after playing a lot of games, but unfortunately we were not up for the battle in the second half.newcastle given, carr, boumsong, bramble, babayaro, dyer, faye, bowyer, robert jenas 77 , ameobi, shearer.goals bowyer 35, dyer 69.bolton jaaskelainen, hunt fadiga 14 , n'gotty, ben haim, candela, giannakopoulos, okocha vaz te 77 , hierro campo 64 , speed, gardner, davies.
