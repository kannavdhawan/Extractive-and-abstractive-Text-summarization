wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead.steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half.in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race.wright phillips' sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin point centre to the feet of mcmanaman.he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much needed pace into the united attack.and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city's best first half chance, rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it even if he needed the help of dunne's leg.on 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney's cross and united seemed home and dry.however, city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range.manchester city boss kevin keegan we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial.but we still had four good chances, two after we'd gone 2 0 down, the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.man city james, mills bradley wright phillips 83 , dunne, distin, thatcher, shaun wright phillips, barton macken 68 , sibierski, mcmanaman, musampa, fowler.man utd carroll, gary neville, ferdinand, brown, heinze, o'shea ronaldo 33 , keane, fortune, fletcher giggs 64 , rooney, scholes phil neville 84 .booked rooney, scholes, keane.goals rooney 68, dunne 75 og.
