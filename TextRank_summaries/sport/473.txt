faultless federer has no equal roger federer nice bloke, fantastic tennis player the ultimate sportsman.hewitt, at times in houston, showed form which easily matched his grand slam winning efforts of 2001 and 2002.i've dominated all the top ten players.i am dominating the game right now and i hope it continues the number one player in the world is also the main man for promoting the sport off court.every match, from first round to final, is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages english, french and swiss german.after a major win, there are extra requests, obligations and interviews, all seen through to the end with courtesy and, most importantly, good humour.you guys are funny, i have a good time with you guys, he said, genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder.if i can promote tennis and the sport then that is good for me.what a refreshing attitude from someone who could easily dominate the sports pages for a decade.now he just needs to find a way of winning the french open, the one grand slam to so far elude him.
