white prepared for battle tough scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england's six nations opener in cardiff on saturday.the leicester tight head is in the form of his life, making the england number three shirt his own.he has played a bit at tight head but i think his favoured position is loose head and he is very good, he added.the 31 year old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight head prop in the world.but my form is helped by the people i play with at leicester people like martin johnson and graham rowntree.it's been a good season so far and to be in the starting xv for the first game of the six nations is what every player wants.white is now one of the more experienced members of the england squad which takes to the field on saturday.i don't know how much experience a tight head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way, he added.when i first came into the squad, people like jason leonard and martin johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.white missed the vast majority of last year's six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going.and that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red hot atmosphere in cardiff.on form, ireland should be favourites but you just don't know that's the great thing about this tournament.
