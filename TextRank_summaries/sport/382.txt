rico gear ran in two of the all blacks' seven tries in what was a predominantly second string line up.the baa baas did threaten, scoring tries through albert van den bergh, xavier rush and andrea lo cicero, but never looked like winning.they learnt from the older players and this was a way of thanking the guys who had been mentoring them on the tour.marty holah got the all blacks onslaught under way with his fifth minute try before rush hit back moments later.jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks' tally before the final whistle, while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa baas.after the match, barbarians coach bob dwyer warned that south african flanker schalk burger needed a proper off season break to maintain his standards.burger, 21, was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board, but has struggled for form in recent weeks.i don't think he's played anywhere near that level on tour, he said.
