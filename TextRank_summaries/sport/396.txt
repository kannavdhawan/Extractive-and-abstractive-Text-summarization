that's the last thing on our minds at the moment, said williams, a second half replacement in saturday's 24 18 win over france in paris.we've come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we'll worry about ireland hopefully after we've beaten scotland.with captain gareth thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.kevin morgan is probably favourite to replace thomas at full back, leaving williams and hal luscombe to battle for the right wing berth.scotland secured their first win of the campaign on saturday by grinding out an 18 10 win over italy.matt williams' side has shown little in attack, but johnson insisted the scots will be difficult opposition to break down.italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it's very hard to win, he said.
