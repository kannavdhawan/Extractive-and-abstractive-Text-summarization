federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.but ljubicic, who beat tim henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak.swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6 3.the match was a re run of last week's final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam, where federer triumphed, but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets.i really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and i did, and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm, federer said.i had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.
