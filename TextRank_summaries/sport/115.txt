john toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding mark hughes, admits he is surprised that giggs has only just reached the landmark.with the games he's played for united, proportionately it doesn't seem that many for wales, toshack said.giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for wales in the 2008 european championships.the manchester united wing revealed how club manager sir alex ferguson talked him into extending his wales career.he feels, like myself, that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years' time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former wales skipper gary speed and united team mate paul scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football.the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17 year old in 1991, an away loss to germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31.for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain, it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that, toshack said.on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes, and giggs said it's my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it, and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in.giggs' own personal future at old trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with manchester united offering one extra year and giggs seeking two.we have massive games coming up manchester city this week, then the everton cup tie, followed by ac milan in the champions league, and my first wales game under john toshack, so it's an important time.
