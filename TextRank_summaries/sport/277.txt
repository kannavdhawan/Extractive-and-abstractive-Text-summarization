i can't say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas, said o'neill.bulgaria's game comes between celtic's boxing day meeting with hearts and their 2 january fixture against livingston.when we were out playing barcelona, i spoke with the bulgarian manager, hristo stoichkov, and he mentioned this game to me.i have said this before, but bulgaria are the one nation who seem to organise a lot of friendly games.
