greek duo cleared in doping case sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the athens olympics.but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport.kenteris, 31, and thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv, chicago and athens and failing to notify anti doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics.it was the international olympic committee's demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal.the head of that tribunal, kostas panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens.this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one.spokesman nick davies said we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest.
