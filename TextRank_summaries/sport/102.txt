gerrard plays down european hopes steven gerrard has admitted that liverpool have little chance of winning the champions league this season.rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind right now , he told bbc radio five live.the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings champions league qualification and they face chelsea in sunday's carling cup final.we're fighting for the fourth spot for the champions league for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important.we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good.
