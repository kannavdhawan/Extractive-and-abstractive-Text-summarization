before the game if you had said the score will be 3 1 i would have happily accepted that, said benitez.benitez defended goalkeeper jerzy dudek, whose failure to hold on to dimitar berbatov's weak drive allowed franca to score with the last kick of the game and give the german team a lifeline for the second leg.he had played a very good game and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal.if we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal.and the liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper steven gerrard, who was suspended for the anfield leg, back for the return in germany.steven gerrard is a key player for us, said benitez.
