rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination free supplements in time for the new season.the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements.in response, the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination free drinks and nutritional bars for the men's tour.the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee, so hopefully all this will never happen again, said rusedski.hopefully after the australian open we won't have to discuss this any more.
