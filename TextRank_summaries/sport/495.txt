roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season.and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open, two more followed at wimbledon and the us open.federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles, and set about conquering new ground.andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon, and federer's performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking.federer again got the better of hewitt in the season ending masters cup.the russian women finally delivered on their long recognised promise in 2004, with myskina, maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams, before taking the season ending fed cup.only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo, whose grand slam drought goes on.the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.a virus ruined the rest of henin hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win olympic gold, but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004.in their absence, myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all russian final at the french open.kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year.with the russians still improving, the likes of henin hardenne, clijsters, davenport, mauresmo, venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005.
