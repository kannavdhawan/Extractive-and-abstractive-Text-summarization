murphy that was a bruising battle that's what i call a tough game.it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory.it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early.we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually.it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it.in the backs, we were not frustrated at such, but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical.it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee.that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half.so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball.every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon.
