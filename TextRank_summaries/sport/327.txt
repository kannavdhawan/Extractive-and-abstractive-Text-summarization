sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland.sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date.delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak.with michalak overlooked, the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales.the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half time, said sella.this season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 world cup, said sella, which laporte is doing very well.it may not seem good now that we're not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we're world champions.but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales, he said the win was most important .france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday 12 march.but sella added people forget that france can still win the six nations and they'll be focused on that.
