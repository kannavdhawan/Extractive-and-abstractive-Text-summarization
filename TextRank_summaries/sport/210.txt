tevez an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil.another boca juniors player is coming to brazil.'the new maradona' carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly 20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year.corinthians or the london based company who have just entered into partnership with them appear to have paid well above the odds for tevez.it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil, where the argentine championship is not shown.and off the pitch he gave the press plenty to report atletico madrid gave up on him after declaring his private life to be 'disorganized.' hounded by the press, tevez grew tired of his life in buenos aires.so now he says that he is heading for corinthians in search of 'tranquillity.brazil's biggest city is a sprawling, ugly, restless metropolis.the most turbulent place in this frenetic city is sport club corinthians.it is the most passionately supported club in brazil.that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays, when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil's big cities.corinthians fans have invaded the dressing room or ambushed the team coach to attack the players.like so many of the top south american players, tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left, to pass when he was expected to dribble, to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares.
