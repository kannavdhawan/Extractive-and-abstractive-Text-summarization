moya emotional after davis cup win carlos moya described spain's davis cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat andy roddick to end the usa's challenge in seville.moya made up for missing spain's 2000 victory through injury by beating roddick 6 2 7 6 7 1 7 6 7 5 to give the hosts an unassailable 3 1 lead.spain's only other davis cup title came two years ago in valencia, when they beat australia.some people have said that i am obsessed but i think that it is better this way.he had lost three times to roddick, and this was his day to beat him.spain's victory was also remarkable for the performance of rafael nadal, who beat roddick in the opening singles.aged 18 years and 185 days, the mallorcan became the youngest player to win the davis cup.what a great way to finish the year, said nadal afterwards.i think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.but certainly i think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff, said mcenroe.
