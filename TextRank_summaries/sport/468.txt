classy henman makes winning start tim henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6 1 7 5 victory over argentine david nalbandian at the kooyong classic exhibition tournament on wednesday.henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against nalbandian when serving for the match at 5 4.it's a great start to the year just what i was looking for, henman told his website.over the years i've found david very difficult to play against.beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.i'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year i was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where i didn't do anything, said henman.i felt pretty good, said the american.i liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, i felt like i was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.
