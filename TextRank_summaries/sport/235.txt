wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.the pair's long running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace .wenger initially refused to bite back, saying only i will never answer any questions any more about this man.but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association.the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss, in an interview with the independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october.united won 2 0 that day, at old trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson's clothes covered in soup and pizza.in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself, ferguson said on saturday.he ran at me with hands raised saying 'what do you want to do about it ' to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable.those allegations were put to wenger after saturday's game at bolton, which arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind chelsea in the title race.but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game.reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace , wenger added i don't respond to anything.ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public.but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense.david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here.during that stormy game in october, united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal's ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle.wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined 15,000 and severely reprimanded by the football association.ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy's tackle, which earned the dutchman a ban, could have given cole a serious injury , but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors.wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit, he added.maybe it is just manchester united, they don't lose many games to other teams.
