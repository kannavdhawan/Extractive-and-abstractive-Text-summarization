robben sidelined with broken foot chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.robben had an mri scan on the injury, sustained during the premiership win at blackburn, on monday.and he added it felt different then last summer when i had the same injury on my other foot.chelsea physio mike banks was hopeful that robben could return at some point in march.but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months.i felt it straight away after mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.
