robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales.robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11 9 loss as he contemplates sunday's set to with france at twickenham.olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour.the bath fly half cum centre is likely to start against france, with either tait or noon dropping out.robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to england's future.he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build up to wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson's cross kick into touch, all inside the first quarter.his contribution improved in the second half, but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role.
