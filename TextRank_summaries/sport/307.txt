wales critical of clumsy grewcock wales coach mike ruddock says england lock danny grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked dwayne peel.trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of wales' 11 9 win in cardiff as grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving peel bloodied.last june grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against new zealand.six years earlier, also in new zealand, grewcock became only the second england player to be sent off in tests.the player himself and his captain jason robinson have both said that the clash with peel was accidental.if the ball is at the back of the ruck and i feel i can step over and disrupt it then i will do that, said grewcock.the boy himself should look at his actions, it was a clumsy piece of footwork, he said.our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team, but it's something we'll talk about in selection this week, said ruddock.
