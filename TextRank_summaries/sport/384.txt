a late try by borders substitute jonny weston had set up a dramatic finish, but the scottish side could not complete the fightback.ulster had led 20 6 with tries from paul steinmetz and bryn cunningham.borders had edged ahead with a sixth minute penalty by charlie hore only to hand the visitors the initiative via a gift try.substitute joe pattison who had come on for the injured gareth morton wrongly thought the ball was trickling out of play and eased up on the chase.first, mark blair was yellow carded for killing the ball on the ground and then full back cunningham bagged the second touchdown in the wake of fine work by skipper andy ward.even worse was to come for borders when larkin kicked two more penalties just before the break, the second of which also led to kelly brown being sin binned.borders are a tougher proposition this year in spite of the fact that they have not had a victory in some time, said mccall.in the first 20 minutes we were edgy but in the second 20 minutes we played some of our best rugby this season and scored two good tries.morton, moffat, macrae, hore, berthinussen, warnock, moore, thomson, ford, douglas, blair, stewart, gray, brown, mcentee.cunningham, maxwell, bell, steinmetz, howe, larkin, campbell, s.
