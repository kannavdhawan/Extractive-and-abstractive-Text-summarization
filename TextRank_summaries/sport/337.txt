prop jones ready for hard graft adam jones says the wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful france pack in paris.the prop said if we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it.we will see how good france are and the scrum is the key.wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france, having secured back to back wins under graham henry in 1999 and 2001.gethin jenkins won't be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will, said jones, who will be facing france for the first time.me and gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of mefin's experience in there.but what is the saying if you are good enough you are old enough and gethin certainly is.
