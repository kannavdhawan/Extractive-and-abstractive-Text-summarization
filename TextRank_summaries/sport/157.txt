kolo toure's late goal gives the gunners hope for the second leg, but wenger said the only positive is that we are still in the tie.goalscorer toure was also at fault for two goals, and wenger said we need to help toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.this was a bad night but i still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.but wenger's bayern counterpart felix magath was in no mood to celebrate either.my players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.arsenal keeper jens lehmann, whose personal rivalry with bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn was not helped by the result, said do i blame myself for the third goal as a goalkeeper, i always blame myself.in my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that but sometimes it happens.
