arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane.it is absolutely not true, arnesen told bbc radio five live.he has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself.arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge.arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before tottenham's premiership fixture with charlton.when it comes down to personal problems, i don't think we should talk about timing, he said.tottenham's structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.however, former spurs and england defender gary stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift.i think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at white hart lane and santini, stevens told five live.
