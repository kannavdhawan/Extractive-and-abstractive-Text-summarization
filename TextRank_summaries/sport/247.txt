real will finish abandoned match real madrid and real socieded will play the final six minutes of their match, which was abandoned on sunday because of a bomb scare.the bernabeu was evacuated with the score at 1 1 and two minutes of normal time remaining in the game.real sociedad president jose luis astiazaran said we thought the best thing was to play the time remaining.the two clubs met the spanish fa on monday and astiazaran added we thought about giving the game as concluded but after talking with the fa we decided there was no precedent for that and the best thing was to play the time that was remaining.i'd like to highlight the behaviour of the fans, who showed great maturity and it was an example of good citizenship, he said.
