henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson.he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand.wales fly half stephen jones was another player who impressed me.with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly half.jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game.england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top.hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game his defence is right up there.cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward.the star of ireland's win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand.gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield.one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum half dwayne peel.they had good possession and he kicked the ball away i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum half after that.
