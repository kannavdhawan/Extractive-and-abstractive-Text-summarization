almunia will start tuesday's champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday.wenger said you don't think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game, do you i don't do that.wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27 year old spaniard, who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back up to jens lehmann.you put your best team out, no matter who it is.i think he's a great keeper, as is almunia.just because lehmann doesn't play for two or three weeks, or longer or shorter, it doesn't mean i've lost faith in him.but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated.he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first team choice.it puts a lot of pressure on them but it's a good learning process, said wenger.and the 30 year old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal.campbell said it means a lot to me to go through, it's everything.meanwhile, thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league.and the striker said if we don't win and we go out of the competition, like it or not, it's going to be my fault.if the team don't win i know i will be criticised, no matter how i play.
