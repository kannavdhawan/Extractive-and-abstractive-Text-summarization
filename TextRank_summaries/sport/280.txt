chelsea boss jose mourinho admitted his side were lucky to win at fratton park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year.he added we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and, although i understand the traditions of football here at this time of year, it is not good for your health to do it.playing so many games is certainly not healthy, especially for teams who still have european commitment.
