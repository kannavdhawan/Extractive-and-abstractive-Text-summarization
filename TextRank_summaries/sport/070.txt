record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham.agnes samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season.my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships, but she just hasn't convinced herself she is fit enough to do so.on the other hand, i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men's 60m in madrid.jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish.but i haven't seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france's ronald pognon who has run 6.45 seconds will be under threat at the europeans.from a british point of view, sarah claxton's victory in the 60m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet.something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women's national 400m race in a new personal best of 52.98 seconds.aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong 4x400m squad going to the european championships.canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year's shape she would have given defar a real run for her money.but he has only just come over from the usa, so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape.i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly.
