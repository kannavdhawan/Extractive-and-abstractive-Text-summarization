despite joining the squad, the leicester flanker only has a slim chance of playing because of an infection in his finger.if he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell.the chances of him playing are very slim, said coach andy robinson.he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during a 10 minute outing as a replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday.robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line up with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery.it can be frustrating but i've had a lot more game time this season and i'm ready for it, stevens said.stevens will be winning his third cap on sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to new zealand last year.robinson has confirmed that fly half charlie hodgson will be the first choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against france.robinson also admits his side must improve their line out work against irish duo malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game.in each game we've missed a number of line outs, he added.
