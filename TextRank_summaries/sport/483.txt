hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi finals.hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6 3 6 2 1 6 3 6 10 8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick.ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets.and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs.the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set.it was always tough serving second in the fifth set, said hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam.
