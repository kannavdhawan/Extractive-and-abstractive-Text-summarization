to supporters of england, dallaglio could do no wrong.an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003.dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993.displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years, dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three back row positions at international standard.within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa.first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio's decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam.as a member of a new look england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again.the only player to play every minute of england's world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters.following johnson's retirement, dallaglio's career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain.dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of england's most accomplished players, if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country.but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32 year old.although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up, the fact that there is no stand out candidate speaks volumes about dallaglio's massive influence on english rugby.
