winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.kelly had been full of should i, shouldn't i thoughts about going for the double in athens.i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games.what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her.i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained.and if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall.the positive thing to take from paula's olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people including me.purely as a race, paula's victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling.i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy.the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.in the absence of paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve.i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.
