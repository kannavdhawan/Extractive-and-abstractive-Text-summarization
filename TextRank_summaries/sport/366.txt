lomu relishing return to action former all black star jonah lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former england rugby union captain martin johnson's testimonial on 4 june.i actually started training three weeks after my operation but i was very limited until a few months ago.the match on 4 june will be my first 15 man game but i have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things, said lomu.coming back to rugby, people said 'you are dreaming' but it always starts off with a dream.opinion has been divided on whether lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation.at his lowest ebb lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long term target is to play for new zealand again.that is the long term goal and you have to start somewhere.
