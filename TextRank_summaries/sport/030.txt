but come late august, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate, the lack of it.sonia o'sullivan's olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers.at the start of the year, an o'sullivan had been earmarked as ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury.once the track and field action began in athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future.amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition.at the start of the year, several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august, an out of form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province.james mcilroy, gareth turnbull, zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens.800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane.the injury plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3 39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter.pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came.as only death can, it put the year's athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.
