what now for british tennis tim henman's decision to quit davis cup tennis has left the british team with a gargantuan void to fill.and great britain's last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as 1996.bailey told bbc sport after tim's announcement, i doubt greg rusedski will be that far behind him.but without their top two, where does that leave british ambitions in the sport's premier team event captain jeremy bates has singled out alex bogdanovic and andrew murray as potential replacements.the yugoslavian born bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other.he said now we've dropped down to the euro africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.bailey said it will be tough for gb to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up.of those lining up to replace henman, the 17 year old murray, with four futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long term bet.murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over tim's mantle, said bailey.bogdanovic, three years murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under britain's davis cup umbrella.
