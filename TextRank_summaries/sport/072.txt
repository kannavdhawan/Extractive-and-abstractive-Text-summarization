running around the olympics it was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to london's 2012 olympic bid.all the sporting people on the capital's bid team think i'm mad to be taking part in the london marathon.the bid chairman, lord coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an olympic middle distance runner.even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee's ioc evaluation commission, i actually found my running schedule easier to follow.on wednesday, the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening, so i just managed to squeeze in a 45 minute run.we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, i got back on the treadmill.and because it was a rest day i didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either.anyway, i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday.when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors.this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.
