parry relishes anfield challenge bbc sport reflects on the future for liverpool after our exclusive interview with chief executive rick parry.chief executive parry is the man at the helm as liverpool reach the most crucial point in their recent history.parry has to deliver a new 60,000 seat stadium in stanley park by 2007 amid claims of costs spiralling above 120m.throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard, and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate.parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez.this will not come as news to parry, a lifelong liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting.captain gerrard is central to liverpool's plans and parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent.as ever, the player will have the final say, and parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish.in terms of the search for new investment, hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004.morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium.bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool, and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool's future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea.he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium.liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights but the realism of arsenal's stunning 100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape.he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'anfield', but the maths of modern day football decree that multi millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be.through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do.parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players.the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy.
