lions blow to world cup stars british and irish lions coach clive woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year's rbs six nations championship.but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.but woodward added the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark.i think it's absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.and following the all blacks' impressive displays in europe in recent weeks, including a 45 6 humiliation of france, woodward believes the three test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge.their performance in particular against france was simply awesome, said the lions coach.with his customary thoroughness, woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.as a result, woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots.i am told he should be back playing by march and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the lions and there are other players like richard hill in the same boat.
