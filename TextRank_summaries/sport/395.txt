paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday's epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris.welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades .a crestfallen france coach, bernard laporte, simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half .but in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of french pressure in a nail biting final five minutes, wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve.in international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis.but since they threw off the shackles against new zealand in the 2003 world cup, wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place.the confidence in the squad has been building and building since the world cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class, noted coach mike ruddock.ruddock and thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad.the joie de vivre so evident in that magical second half spell in paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s.similarly, wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important.
