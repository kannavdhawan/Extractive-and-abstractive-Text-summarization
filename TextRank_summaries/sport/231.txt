mourinho to escape fa charge chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half time.mourinho was concerned that ferguson's conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official.i see one referee in the first half and another in the second, said mourinho.the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free kicks.but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half time.referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity.i'm hoping he might reconsider his comments, unfortunately this is the nature of the game, said hackett.sometimes managers have grounds for comments, and i note that, but a referees integrity has been questioned, that is offensive and should be avoided.we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is, a footballing power.
