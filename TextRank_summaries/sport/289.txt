fuming robinson blasts officials england coach andy robinson insisted he was livid after his side were denied two tries in sunday's 19 13 six nations loss to ireland in dublin.mark cueto's first half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned tv replays when england crashed over in the dying minutes.south african referee jonathan kaplan ruled that cueto was ahead of charlie hodgson when the fly half hoisted his cross field kick for the sale wing to gather.kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when josh lewsey took the ball over the irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game winning try.i think mark cueto scored a perfectly legal try and i think he should have gone to the video referee on josh lewsey, said robinson.given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players.we have done everything but win a game of rugby, but ireland are a good side.they defended magnificently and they've got every chance of winning this six nations.england have lost their first three matches in this year's six nations and four out of their six games since robinson took over from sir clive woodward in september.
