but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series.the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with australia's triumph in london followed by france's capitulation to new zealand.and for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.that owes much to ireland's continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.they start with away games against italy and scotland, before england and france come to lansdowne road.their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland's self belief, while ronan o'gara's late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o'sullivan's side can now close out tight games.not that england or france, who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson.a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.after two reasonable performances against australia, the scots' humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent., who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship.
