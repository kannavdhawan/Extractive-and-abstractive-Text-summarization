but dallaglio, who called time on england earlier this year, said i assure you i wouldn't let anyone down.dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago.from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester, i certainly didn't feel out of place alongside those players, many of whom will be on the trip.if clive feels he has no need to look outside the international crop, then fine.
