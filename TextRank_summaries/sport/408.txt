italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000, but two of those have come against scotland.scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh, said bortolami.we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs.as a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.
