an early own goal followed by an alan shearer strike earned them a 2 1 win and a place in the uefa cup last 16.but souness said he did not think beating the record would have any bearing on his decision to retire at the end of the season.i think if he got it this year he would want to stay next year anyway, he added.in the first half he did really well and did everything you want from a wide player.
