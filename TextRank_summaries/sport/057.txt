four months later, holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame, won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes.and when asked about her plans for both the indoor and outdoor seasons ahead, the 34 year old has repeatedly chosen to tick the don't know box.but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well, it's a lot easier being the double olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running, points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram.will i have as much commitment, desire and energy to go through a major championship holmes asked in the new year.unless she is certain she has a strong chance of winning any race, she will not step onto the track.the day after completing her double in athens, the 34 year old revealed she would still like to win her first indoors title.on the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn't they be at least shared and celebrated you don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion, agreed cram.i think she will compete and run races on the circuits but whether or not she runs in the major championships is much less certain.athletics fans had every reason to believe they would see the new look kelly holmes tearing up the track again.so, why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again that's just kelly, explains cram.she knows every time she makes a pronouncement now it's headline news.kelly has to figure out for herself what it is she wants and that will be based on athletics decisions, whether she can be competitive, if she is fit enough to put her neck on the line.and if she decides not to run again, no one is going to turn round and say 'you're making the wrong decision.
