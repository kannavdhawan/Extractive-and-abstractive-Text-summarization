ferrero eyes return to top form former world number one juan carlos ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005.the 2003 french open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return.in the past when i was a top seed i would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi finals.despite this, ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season.physically i am 100% since december of last year, said ferrero.the difficult moments were when i knew that i had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover.among the low points of a difficult year for ferrero was the decision of spain captain jordi arrese to drop him for the davis cup final against the usa.it was difficult because i had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that i would play, said ferrero.it was difficult for me not to be in the friday matches but i had to understand.
