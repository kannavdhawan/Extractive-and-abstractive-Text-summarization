mcilroy aiming for madrid title northern ireland man james mcilroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend's spar european indoor championships in madrid.the 28 year old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards.lester is better known for his work with 400m runners roger black and mark richardson in the past but under his guidance mcilroy has secured five wins this indoor season.that was my last decent year, said mcilroy, who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester's shrewd guidance.that situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in erfurt and stuttgart earlier this season.russian dmitriy bogdanov won at the same madrid venue last week and then claimed the european championship race would be between himself, dutchman arnoud okken and antonio reina of spain but mcilroy is unfazed.i never write myself off and let's face it, i haven't or looked like being beaten this season.he said i've been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important.
