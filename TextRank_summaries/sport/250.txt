he was once threatened with the sack by city boss kevin keegan but has since responded with impressive performances, prompting interest from other clubs.i definitely want to stay at city because i have really improved as a player here.newcastle boss graeme souness is said to have been impressed enough by dunne's turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the january transfer window.dunne's professionalism was famously questioned by keegan, who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state.but dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said i've grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad.i have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at newcastle and middlesbrough, defensively we've done quite well.
