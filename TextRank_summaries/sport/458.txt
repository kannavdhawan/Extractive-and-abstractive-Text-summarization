i felt like i was striking the ball much better, said johansson.hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the australian open, which starts on 17 january.when you've been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams, you look at the big picture and what motivates you, said hewitt.that's the grand slams and melbourne's as big for me as any of the four.
