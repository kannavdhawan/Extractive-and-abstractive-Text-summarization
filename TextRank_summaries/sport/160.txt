hodgson relishes european clashes former blackburn boss roy hodgson says the premiership should follow the rest of europe and have a winter break but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the english elite's bid for champions league glory.hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout europe, although not in england where the champions league contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list.it gives players the chance to recharge their batteries midway through the season, which some suggest will give teams an advantage in the champions league.the bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the champions league in february.hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining as i said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.in pre season you get a lot of enthusiasm and energy but by the time you get towards christmas many players, having also played plenty of international matches for club and country and travelled a lot, find themselves getting very jaded.and hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the premiership.he said if we talk about football at elite level, which the premiership is, then i would support a winter break.if you examine the demands of the premier league and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good physically and mentally.
