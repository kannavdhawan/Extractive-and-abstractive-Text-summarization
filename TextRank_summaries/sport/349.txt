we have to make sure the england and france games are tough for them.kirwan said the kicking was the decisive factor in scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time.but i have a lot of confidence in my players and i am positive we can put everything together against england.england, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin.but centre jamie noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats.we have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the italy game.england have now equalled an 18 year low of four successive championship defeats, including france in paris last season, and have lost four in a row under andy robinson.
