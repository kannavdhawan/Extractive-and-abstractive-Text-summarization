williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield.williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership.but he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with berti vogts, recently sacked as scotland football manager after a poor run of results.williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure, despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory.there's nothing much between the teams, so we could win the next three games or lose them.we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too.
