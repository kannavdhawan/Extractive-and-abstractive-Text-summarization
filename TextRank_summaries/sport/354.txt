ireland coach eddie o'sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season's six nations championship.but, like o'sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it.bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of o'sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign.but i doubt whether o'sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players.however, he may look at the overworked and injury hit england, wales and france squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight.already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season.they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam, only the second in ireland's history.but o'sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season.after their first triple crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder.o'sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades .he has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed.ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.
