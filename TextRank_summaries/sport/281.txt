arsenal go into the game on the back of a 2 0 victory over fulham on sunday.and wenger added the best way to prepare for a game is to win the previous one.we do not play a season with 11 players and i believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team.he said what matters is winning and the three points, of course.but it is more enjoyable when you play like we did against fulham.we are playing as a team and that is important because there were some games when we maybe were not there as a team and suffered for that.
