greek pair attend drugs hearing greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.they were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the iaaf in december for failing to take drugs tests before the athens olympics.the pair arrived with former coach christos tzekos to give evidence at the hellenic olympic committee's offices.yiannis papadoyiannakis, who was head of the greek olympic team at the athens games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other greek sports officials and athletes.i believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution, said papadoyiannakis.the five member tribunal, assembled by the hellenic association of amateur athletics, is also examining allegations that kenteris and thanou avoided tests in tel aviv and chicago before the games.in imposing two year suspensions on the duo on 22 december, the iaaf described their explanations for missing the tests as unacceptable .but kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis told bbc sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing.
