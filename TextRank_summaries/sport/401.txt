wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career, and gavin henson is already a welsh legend.the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up ended not just once, but twice, by henson's all enveloping tackles.his kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full back for 10 minutes either side of half time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin bin.one huge clearance from tait's kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half.he also had a hand in the game's only try, finished superbly by williams, and might have scored himself on the half hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by tait.henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson's penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time.replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space, where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.there were still four minutes for wales to hold out, and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away.but it was wales who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax.and, thanks to henson, wales did.
