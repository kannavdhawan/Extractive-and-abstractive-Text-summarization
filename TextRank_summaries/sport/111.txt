we think it's a big injury, said jose mourinho, whose chelsea team this week meet barcelona in the champions league and liverpool in the carling cup final.william gallas and damien duff could also miss the barcelona game.france defender gallas and ireland winger duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of chelsea's 1 0 defeat at st james' park.with bridge having gone off after mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus carlo cudicini's red card meant chelsea finished the game with seven able bodied players.cudicini would not have played against barcelona, but had been promised a game in the carling cup final, although he will now miss the cardiff showpiece through suspension.it could be that paulo ferreira, usually a right back, is switched to left back with glen johnson, who ended the newcastle game in goal, playing on the right.bridge's injury also means mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign ashley cole from arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left back for the run in to the season.he bridge has no chance of playing against barcelona, probably will not play against liverpool in the carling cup final and maybe not for the rest of the season, he said.shearer said he was unsure what caused bridge's injury.
