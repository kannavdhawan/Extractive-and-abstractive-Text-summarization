england's world cup winning fly half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship.but rob andrew, coach of wilkinson's club side newcastle, said that with only two games left to play wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.it would be irresponsible to put him straight into a test match, andrew told the times.that game is the day after england play italy in the six nations and six days before their final match of the championship against scotland.we are hoping jonny will be ready in a fortnight, but it is touch and go, said andrew.despite not playing for england, wilkinson is still hoping to make the lions tour to new zealand this summer.
