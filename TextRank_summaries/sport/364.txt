it has been quite a year for the irish, and not just with eddie o'sullivan's triple crown winning international outfit either.but most of the kudos will go to o'sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record.for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners up spot in the rbs six nations.but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa, ireland finsihed the year on a high.the winning try was conceived in o'sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey.the under 21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider.the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners up to england in the six nations under 21 tournament.on the provincial front, leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager.while ulster finished runners up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was munster again flying the flag for the irish.looking to reach their third final, they went down 37 32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road.ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall.teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under 19 world cup game in durban.the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character, doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season.
