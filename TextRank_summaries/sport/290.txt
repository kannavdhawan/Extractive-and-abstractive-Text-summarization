ireland hooker shane byrne echoed o'gara's comments but admitted the game had been england's best outing in the six nations.byrne said it was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard.ireland captain brian o'driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said we are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter.ireland coach eddie o'sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us.i think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while.o'sullivan also rejected robinson's contention england dominated the forward play.i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i don't know how that adds up to domination, he said.o'driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title.
