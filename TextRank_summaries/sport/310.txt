and in the pack neath swansea ospreys forward ryan jones is preferred at blindside flanker to jonathan thomas.thomas, a try scorer in rome, drops down to the bench instead of ian gough, while cardiff back rhys williams steps up in place of morgan.due to his impressive performances from the bench, kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to hal gives him the chance to start, said ruddock.jonathan thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail.obviously, it's a 22 man game these days, and there is every chance that jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.replacements r mcbryde llanelli , j yapp cardiff , j thomas neath swansea , r sowden taylor cardiff , g cooper newport gwent , c sweeney newport gwent , r williams cardiff .
