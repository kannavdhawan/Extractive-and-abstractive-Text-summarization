smith keen on home series return scotland manager walter smith has given his backing to the reinstatement of the home international series.but smith said bringing it back would add meaning to friendly games and that's something that's needed.the home international series was done away with in 1984, with the traditional scotland england fixture continuing until 1989.the scotland v england match was a highlight of the end of the season, he added.so i would support the return of the home internationals the only problem would be fitting them in to the fixture schedule.
