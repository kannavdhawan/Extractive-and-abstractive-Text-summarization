chelsea clinch cup in extra time after extra time score at 90 mins 1 1 john arne riise volleyed liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but steven gerrard scored a 79th minute own goal.blues boss jose mourinho was sent off for taunting liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game.the blues' attacking chances were limited, and jerzy dudek was equal to frank lampard's powerfully struck drive and drogba's low shot.joe cole had a shot blocked and a promising damien duff break was halted by a good tackle from djimi traore, but the reds reached half time without any major scares.and despite chelsea's possession, it was liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as luis garcia fed dietmar hamann whose shot forced a superb save from cech.and the blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as paulo ferreira denied gerrard with a last ditch tackle.that prompted mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but chelsea still pressed and duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining.drogba almost headed chelsea in front two minutes into extra time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post.there was still drama as nunez beat cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite liverpool's desperate attacks, chelsea clung on to win.dudek, finnan, carragher, hyypia, traore biscan 67 , luis garcia, gerrard, hamann, riise, kewell nunez 56 , morientes baros 74 .cech, paulo ferreira, ricardo carvalho, terry, gallas kezman 74 , jarosik gudjohnsen 45 , lampard, makelele, cole johnson 81 , drogba, duff.lampard, kezman, drogba, duff.
