williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby.but williams said i want to make it clear that i'm committed totally to scottish rugby.i'd like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation, he said.there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case.we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team.they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations.that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations.there must be a win win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning, not competing.
