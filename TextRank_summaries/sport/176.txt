the 29 year old, out of favour at city earlier this season, took his premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in monday's 3 2 win at norwich.he is still a quality player and knows where the net is we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did, keegan said.fowler's double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards.i feel a bit for nigel worthington, he said.i know it is a killer blow for norwich but i really think they have brought something to the premiership.
