some of the latest to update their search systems are ask jeeves and blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web.mr macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before.ask jeeves has added the ability to save websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found.on average, said mr macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily.under my ask jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting.by way of comparison google's desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited.since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google, copernic, enfish, x1 and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web.what users do with blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines.blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems, he said.the variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said mr chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks.
