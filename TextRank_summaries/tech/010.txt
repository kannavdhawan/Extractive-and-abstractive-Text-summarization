google's toolbar sparks concern search engine firm google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre selected commercial websites.the autolink feature comes with google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to amazon.but some users are concerned that google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like amazon.if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique isbn number would link directly to amazon's website.websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services.it said the user can choose never to click on the autolink button, and web pages she views will never be modified.smart tags allowed microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company.google said none of the companies which received autolinks had paid for the service.some users said autolink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any click through to a commercial site.
