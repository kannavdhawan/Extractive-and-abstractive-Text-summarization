the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham's nec, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.motorcycle racer, roy tansley, from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated.i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg, mr tansley told the bbc news website.mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the autocycle union.mr tansley's invention, the pro shift, is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing.in addition to helping disabled riders to compete, mr tansley reckons that the pro shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt.another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities.we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company, said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company.mr hawkins a paraplegic himself says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated.the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.
