no half measures with half life 2 could half life 2 possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time.the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped.the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half life.it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here.underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen.whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride, wandering through half life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications.so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move.there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force.freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.at times half life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome.firstly, the carefully scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it.if you like things open ended and free ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing.but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run.installing it proved a life draining siege that would test a saint's patience.developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy.it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances but luckily, half life 2 is up to the challenge.it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre.half life 2 is out now for the pc
