imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e mails.his creator, richard bowden, lecturer at the centre for vision, speech and signal processing at the university of surrey, refers to jeremiah as him , rather than it.jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity.if you leave, he gets sad.it works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system.the surrey team is already working on jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature finn the fish.i am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that, explained dr bowden.experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on.but it might all depend on the face that is watching you.when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them, said dr bowden.
