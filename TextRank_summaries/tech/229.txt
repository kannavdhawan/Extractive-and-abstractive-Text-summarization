robotic pods take on car design a new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by japanese car giant toyota.the company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st century involves the driver cruising by in a four wheeled leaf like device or strolling along encased in an egg shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet.both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi, japan, in march 2005.the open leaf like i unit vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year.built using environmentally friendly plant based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes.they are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production, said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university.as always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace.the personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities.with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs.while toyota's prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.dr erel avineri, of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled.it looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need.such single person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport.the concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions, said dr gillingwater.
