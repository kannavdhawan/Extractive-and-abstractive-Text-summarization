be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them.after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us.many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement.it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.the new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid 1980s.they have come to a head now after a year in which proposals were made, endorsed by the council of ministers, radically modified by the european parliament and then re presented in their original form.this goes to the heart of the european project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried.if coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent.the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents.even this system breaks down, of course, as microsoft found out last year when they initially lost a case brought by eolas which claimed that internet explorer and other browsers infringed an eolas patent.but small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade.much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements.the damage to software will not happen overnight, of course.if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products.the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas.
