despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said jupiter.a separate study by gartner has also said real time tv broadcasts to mobiles is unlikely in europe until 2007.batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others.fifty percent of europeans said the size of a mobile was the most important factor when it came to choosing their phone, but more power demands tend to mean larger handsets.mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready, said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research.with phones getting smarter and more powerful, there are also demands to be able to watch tv on the move.in the us, services like tivo to go let people transfer pre recorded tv content onto their phones.a service from the norwegian broadcasting corporation lets people watch tv programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day.operators will be working on the standard as a way to bring real time broadcasts to mobiles, as well as trying to overcome several other barriers.handsets also need to be able to work with the dvb h standard.people are also likely to be put off watching tv on such small screens, said gartner.digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video on demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch.
