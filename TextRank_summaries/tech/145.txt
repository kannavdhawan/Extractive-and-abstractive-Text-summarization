musicians 'upbeat' about the net musicians are embracing the internet as a way of reaching new fans and selling more music, a survey has found.the study by us researchers, pew internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing.even successful artists don't think the lawsuits will benefit musicians, said report author mary madden.for part of the study, pew internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004.independent musicians, in particular, saw the internet as a way to get around the need to land a record contract and reach fans directly.perhaps surprisingly, opinions about online file sharing were diverse and not as clear cut as those of the record industry.it found that most artists saw file sharing as both good and bad, though most agreed that it should be illegal.many suggested that rather than fighting file sharing, the music industry needed to recognise the changes it has brought and embrace it.both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy, said ms madden.
