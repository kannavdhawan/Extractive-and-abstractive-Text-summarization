us top of supercomputing charts the us has pushed japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue gene l machine.ibm test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second.once completed in 2005, blue gene l will be more powerful than its current prototype.in second place was silicon graphics' columbia supercomputer based at the us space agency's nasa ames research center in california.the linux based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 trillion calculations per second teraflops in october.since the first supercomputer, the cray 1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory, us, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
