you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer.carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people.the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might.i come from a village, says prof reddy, i know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach.after all, he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead, prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market.it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this, prof reddy says.people do this today with television sets.literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control.this dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd.prassana rambathla, one of prof reddy's graduate students, says that when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software.prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley.the answer, says prof brewer, is wi fi.prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about 10 a month, and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities.reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt's other technologies such as video mail.prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off.
