'podcasters' look to net money nasa is doing it, 14 year old boys in bedrooms are doing it, couples are doing it, gadget lovers male and female are definitely doing it.it is podcasting diy radio in the form of downloadable mp3 audio files.some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement text based weblogs diary like sites where people share their thoughts.they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the movement is at very early stages.it's about real people saying real things and communicating, says adam curry, former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting.those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe for free to that show's feed .it is totally going to kill the business model of radio, thinks curry.and they are scared to death of the next generation like my daughter who is 14 who don't listen to radio.it is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it.ian fogg, jupiter research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like apple and microsoft, get involved.podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about a classic hybrid.curry's daily source code which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community has 10s of thousands of listeners.he designed the format called rss really simple syndication , which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like.no matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn't going to make very much money, he says.podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with 'audiences' measured in the single digits, like e mail or blogs.curry and associate ron bloom's new venture, called podshow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts.because of the way podcasts work, based on rss, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready made targets.when you look at podcasting wow this is a pretty interesting audience.if you are talking a million podcasters, and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves, then that is kind of interesting.essentially, he says, if you are doing a bass fishing podcast, someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show.the creative forces behind radio are elated, says curry.for now, he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community.i should be knighted for this, he adds, with a wry chuckle, people are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money.
