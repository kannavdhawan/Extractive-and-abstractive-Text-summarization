podcasts mark rise of diy radio an apple ipod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill.but more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers.it is called podcasting and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj video jockey adam curry.podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast.a podcast is basically an internet based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home.using technology based on xml computer code and rss really simple syndication listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which mr curry has pioneered.mr curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called the daily source code.he wants to make podcasting the next big thing and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry.mr curry is american, but he grew up in the netherlands where he hosted illegal, pirate radio shows in the dutch capital.he spent the next seven years in new york where he worked at mtv hosting the top 20 video countdown, but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet.but mr curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high speed internet connections were becoming more widely available.most importantly, mr curry says, people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing.he wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like, ipods.he put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it the result is a work in progress called ipodder .people can wake up in the morning, pick up their ipods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players.already, websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.chris mcintyre runs podcast alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know how to simply listen.some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the anti radio into something that is more like conventional broadcasting.for his part, adam curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be.he loves doing the daily source code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences.he has even been called the ed sullivan or johnny carson of podcasting which, he says, is a badge i'll wear with great honour.
