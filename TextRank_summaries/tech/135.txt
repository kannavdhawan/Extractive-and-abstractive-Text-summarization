gta sequel is criminally good the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years, but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.the 18 certificate gta san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best selling formula with a more of the same approach.you control a character, on this occasion a youth named cj, who sets out on a series of self contained missions within a massive 3d environment.to make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn.the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas, comprising three major cities los santos, which is a thinly disguised los angeles, san fierro, aka san francisco and las venturas, a carbon copy of las vegas.san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the game's overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous.at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, san andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade.developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game.a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where gta games' trademark humour is anchored.the game's rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed.it is a testament to san andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus points are so numerous that the niggles don't detract.and the game suffers from the age old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission.but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive.san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.
