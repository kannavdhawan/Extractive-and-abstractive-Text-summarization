text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation.so mr senanayake started sending out text messages.blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders.and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use.sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call, he says.half a world away, in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago, taran rampersad read morquendi's messages.mr rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster.he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help.mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect.he can message the server, so the server can send out an e mail message and human or machine moderators can e mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.he added or, send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.last week, he sent out e mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.you may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e mail away, he said, that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy.right now, the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web page, or distribute it to an e mail list.in the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages.
