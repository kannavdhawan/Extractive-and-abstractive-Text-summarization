apple laptop is 'greatest gadget' the apple powerbook 100 has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time, by us magazine mobile pc.the magazine has compiled an all time top 100 list of gadgets, which includes the sony walkman at number three and the 1956 zenith remote control at two.the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own, not a subset of another device .in general we included only items that were potentially mobile, said the magazine.the oldest gadget in the top 100 is the abacus, which the magazine dates at 190 a.other pre electronic gadgets in the top 100 include the sextant from 1731 59th position , the marine chronometer from 1761 42nd position and the kodak brownie camera from 1900 28th position .the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top 10, which also includes the first flash mp3 player diamond multimedia , as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv 10 and mobile phone motorola startac .the most popular gadget of the moment, the apple ipod, is at number 12 in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number 13.karl elsener's knife, the swiss army knife from 1891, is at number 20 in the list.gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone 23rd , the nintendo gameboy 25th , and the pulsar quartz digital watch 36th .almost everyone has a mobile phone, how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing.for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc, flash mp3, portable cd players etc.my favourite 'true' gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee calm down it's only in their opinion, and any list that includes the taser in the top 100 gadgets has to be suspect.how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful popular you don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses.brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple, tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe .lap tops may enable you to think different, but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars, one of the pioneers for computer games, i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today however tried it the other day and it was rubbish, still a great gadget of its time.for it's time, a technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp3 player to explode onto the market.a laptop computer is not a gadget it's a working tool the sinclair executive was the world's first pocket calculator.how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people, not just pc magazine editors.are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication, which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop.from outside the modern age, the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget, without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly.of the electronic gadgets, thousands of journalists in the early 1980s blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy 100.what's an apple powerbook 100 it's out of date not much of a gadget .surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener, swiss army knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone.no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time.the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in 1980.all top 10 are electronic toys, so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anything else.yes, the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets.but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer 'gadgets' and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective.how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife.by far the most useful gadget.the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of.why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices.i'd have put the mobile phone high up the list.i wish more modern notebooks even apple's newest offerings were more like the pb100.
