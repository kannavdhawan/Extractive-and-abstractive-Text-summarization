gamers could drive high definition tv, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.to view it, it needs to be transmitted in hd format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high quality resolution.and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high resolution pictures.in the next generation of consoles hd support is mandatory, dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website.so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high detail pictures.most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels.probably, in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this tv can do', until hd is really adopted by broadcasters, explains dr tuffy.demographics have changed too and the sweet spot for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s.this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big screen, high definition display technologies and hd projectors, earlier than others.higher capacity storage discs, such as hd dvd and blue ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.for console developers though, hd offers some production changes.with hd, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big screen cinema release.but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide.at that point, says dr tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.
