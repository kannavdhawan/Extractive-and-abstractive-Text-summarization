indeed, it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.however, last year was the final time that developers sports interactive si and publishers eidos would work together.eidos announced the next cm game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst si developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers sega, under the name football manager.so what does this mean well, football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series, and it has been released earlier than expected.but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics.it has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans.what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance england and scotland.however, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well things like the manager mind games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses.with a game that is so complex and so open ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases.with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area.and a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction.if you were a fan of the previous cm games, then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it.football manager 2005 out now for the pc and the mac
