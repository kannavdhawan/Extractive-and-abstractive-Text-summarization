blu ray, backed by 100 firms including sony, is competing against toshiba and nec backed hd dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games.the blu ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format.the next generation of dvds will hold high definition video and sound.in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.as we move from standard definition video images to high definition images, we have a much greater need for storage, richard doherty, from panasonic's hollywood laboratories, one of the pioneers of blu ray, told the bbc news website.a blu ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high quality data, while toshiba's hd dvd will hold 30gb.mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high definition needs, including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders.both toshiba and blu ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war, akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next generation dvd players start to come out.the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical disc technologies, said michael heilmann, chief technology officer for vivendi universal.blu ray offers the capacity, performance and high speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming.ea, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high definition games of the future was vital and blu ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning.mr doherty said gamers were ravenous for high quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles.fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost.likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better, high resolution games.
