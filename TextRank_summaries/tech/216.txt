tv future in the hands of viewers with home theatre systems, plasma high definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time.with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.one of the most talked about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders dvr and pvr .these set top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.not only can people forward wind through adverts, they can also forget about abiding by network and channel schedules, putting together their own a la carte entertainment.but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as brand identity and viewer loyalty to channels.what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers.it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.of the 50,000 new gadgets and technologies being showcased at ces, many of them are about enhancing the tv watching experience.high definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd liquid crystal display tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.one such example launched at the show is humax's 26 inch lcd tv with an 80 hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder.one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100 hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.
