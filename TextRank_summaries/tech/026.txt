the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out.spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines.but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place.as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped.david stanley, uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust, said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers.while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too.mr hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses.for instance, said mr hogan, filtering out e mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.
