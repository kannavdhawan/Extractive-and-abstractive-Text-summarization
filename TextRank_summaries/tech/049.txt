domain system scam fear a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.but the uk internet forum ukif is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily.registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif.domain names are the real language addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers.the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'.but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake.as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said.although the idn problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked, said mr dyer.another solution, to introduce idn disabled browsers could be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water, he said.
