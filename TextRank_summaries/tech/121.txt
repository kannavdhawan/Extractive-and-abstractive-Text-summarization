by playing games, like pass the parcel, a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations.the study's findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human robot interaction.we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists, said professor kerstin dautenhahn, project leader at hertfordshire.without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds, professor dautenhahn told bbc news online.to find out how they would react, the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass the parcel with children.if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future, concluded professor dautenhahn.
