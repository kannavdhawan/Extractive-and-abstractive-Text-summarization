gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's sands of time, the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.the only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry empress of time before she ever creates the sands of time that caused the great beast's creation.ever since the series' then groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga, prince of persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect.the game's developers have combined acrobatic flair with gruesome slaying techniques in some wonderfully imaginative ways.warrior within is a very slick package the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.it is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti climax.that said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game.perhaps precisely because its graphics and mechanics are so good that the story and overall experience are not quite as engaging as they should be.
