ink helps drive democracy in asia the kyrgyz republic, a small, mountainous state of the former soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as an island of democracy , the kyrgyz president, askar akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections the german embassy, the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.at the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot.if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station.the use of ink has been controversial especially among groups perceived to be pro government.widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems.this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as serbia, south africa, indonesia and turkey.the use of invisible ink is not without its own problems.the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills.the passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections.
