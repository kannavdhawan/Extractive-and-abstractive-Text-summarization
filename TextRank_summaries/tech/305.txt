finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio, which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures.if you have a visual radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you've just been listening to.that visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to.as well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's red button content.but the interactive aspect will make the service especially attractive to radio stations, who will be able to track the number of people taking part in such activities on a real time basis.as the visual radio content is transmitted by existing gprs technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network.one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006.the first visual radio service in the uk will begin in a few months time with virgin radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners.station manager steve taylor commented listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.
