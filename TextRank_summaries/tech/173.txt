supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm's prototype blue gene l machine.doe test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of 70.72 teraflops.the current top machine, japan's nec earth simulator, clocks up 35.86.it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second.until the official list is published, however, blue gene l's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries.surpassing the 40 trillion calculations per second teraflop mark has been considered a landmark for some time.the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005.but in september, ibm said that another blue gene l machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops, marginally surpassing the earth simulator's performance.the linux based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of 42.7 teraflops in october.their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts, help design better cars, and improve disease diagnosis.ibm's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, nick donofrio, believes that by 2006, blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing.when you get a computer as large as a petaflop, you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world, mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website.one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing and blue gene machines in particular as crucial is health.compared with the current fastest supercomputers, blue gene is designed to consume one 15th the power and be 10 times more compact.since the first supercomputer, the cray 1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
