it is a pilot project run by eduvision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks.matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates.the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e slates.it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it.it's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content.then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity.but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions.we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.maciej sundra, who designed the user interface for the e slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world.
