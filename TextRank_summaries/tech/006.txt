wi fi web reaches farmers in peru a network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.the pilot scheme in the huaral valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital lima, aims to offer the 6,000 strong community up to date information on agricultural market prices and trends.the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions.the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system, said carlos saldarriaga, technical coordinator at cepes.the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system, with its flagship huaral.the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems.it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it, mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website.the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project they feel it belongs to them, said mr saldarriaga.the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo, a 50 family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site.
