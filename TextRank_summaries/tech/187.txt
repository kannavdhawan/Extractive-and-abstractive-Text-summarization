a question of trust and technology a major government department is without e mail for a week, and technology analyst bill thompson wants to know what happened.it seems that thousands of civil servants at the uk's department of work and pensions went through the same thing last week.it has emerged that the internal network crashed in a particularly horrible way, depriving staff of e mail and access to the application software they use to calculate people's benefit and pension entitlement or note changes in personal circumstances.senior consultants from eds, the computer firm which manage the system, and microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done.fortunately the back office systems which actually pay people their money were still working, so only new claims and updates were affected done properly.although the full story has not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong, and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network.this is certainly unfortunate, but i have a lot of sympathy for the network managers and technology staff involved.so i will reserve judgment on the technology aspects until we all know what actually happened and whether it was a consequence of software failure or just bad luck.a major system has evidently collapsed and we need to know what went wrong and what is being done differently.
