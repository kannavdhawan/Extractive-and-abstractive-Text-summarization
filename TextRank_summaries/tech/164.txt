the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name.and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving.identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.but, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to.and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files.in fact i do not know of a single case where an e mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it.the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.
