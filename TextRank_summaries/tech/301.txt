apple offer a less powerful mac mini for 339 but the 399 models has a 1.4ghz power pc chip, 80 gigabyte hard drive, combined cd burner dvd player.it comes equipped with usb and firewire ports for peripheral connections, ethernet port for broadband, a port for standard video output and an audio headphone jack.the machine comes with mac os x, the apple operating system, the software suite ilife, which includes itunes, iphoto, imovie, idvd and garageband.apple are targeting people who already have a main computer and want to upgrade especially pc users who have used an apple ipod.compact and stylish, the mac mini would not look out of place in any home.the package of software that comes with the machine is the best money can buy.macs don't offer the upgrade flexibility of a pc and the machine's specifications lack the horse power for tasks such as high end video editing or games.the mac mini puts the macintosh within the reach of everyone, an apple spokesman said.an entry level machine designed for basic home use.a 2.6ghz intel celeron chip, 40 gigabyte hard drive, 256mb, combined cd burner dvd player.the machine comes with windows xp home edition.a dvd burner, or any wireless components built in.wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.wireless and a dvd burner can be added at extra cost.the dell provides enough power and software for basic gaming and internet surfing.it's easily upgradeable so a bigger hard drive, better sound and graphics cards can be added.this machine is for small businesses and for people who want a second computer for basic home use, perhaps in a kids bedroom, a spokesman for dell said.i think we offer better value once you realise all the extras needed for the mac mini.for your money you get a 1.8ghz amd sempron processor, 512mb of ram, 120gb hard drive, dvd writer, 16 inch monitor, mouse, keyboard and windows xp2 much more than the basics.some of the upgrades offered by jal to the basic model are pricey.nick ross, deputy labs editor at pc pro, said the important point about buying a cheap and cheerful pc is the upgrade path.a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp 2500 processor, 512 megabytes ram, a graphics card with 128 ram on board plus tv out, a 40 gb hard drive, cd writer and dvd player, windows xp home.you're building it so you have to buy all the software you want to install and do your own trouble shooting and tech support.once it's built you won't be able to do much with it until you start buying software for it.performance wise, it's not 'cutting edge' and is barely entry level by today's market, but up against the mac mini, i believe it will hold its own and even pull a few more tricks, says gavin cox.by contrast, says mr cox, the mac mini is almost disposable.
