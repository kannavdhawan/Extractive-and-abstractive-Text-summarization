rich pickings for hi tech thieves viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home pcs.instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs.before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines.he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order.few of the malicious programs written by hi tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data.as the tactics used by malicious programs change, said mr king, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves.so called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites.in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.
