also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers, called bot nets, used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes.one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast spreading virus, said kevin hogan, senior manager in symantec's security response group.although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said mr hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs.his comment was echoed by graham cluley, senior technology consultant from anti virus firm sophos.the anti phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month.this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e mail messages.they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses, said mr hogan.the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky, bagle and mydoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated.mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in bot nets that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.part of the reason that these bot nets have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created.by contrast, said mr hogan, the code for viruses such as gaobot, spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time.also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones.on the positive side, finnish security firm f secure said that 2004 was the best ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally minded hackers.in total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so called 29a virus writing group were sentenced.
