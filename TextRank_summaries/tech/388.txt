camera phones are 'must haves' four times more mobiles with cameras in them will be sold in europe by the end of 2004 than last year, says a report from analysts gartner.the report predicts that nearly 70% of all mobile phones sold will have a built in camera by 2008.but in japan and asia pacific, where camera phone technology is much more advanced, mobiles have already been released which can take 3.2 megapixel images.camera phones had some teething problems when they were first launched as people struggled with poor quality images and uses for them, as well as the complexity and expense of sending them via mms multimedia messaging services .realising that people like to use their camera phones in different ways, they have introduced more design features, like rotating screens and viewfinders, removable memory cards and easier controls to send picture messages.but the report suggests that until image quality increases more, people will not be interested in printing out pictures at kiosks.image sensor technology inside cameras phones is improving.the gartner report suggests that by mid 2005, it is likely that the image resolution of most camera phones will be more than two megapixels.some handsets already feature limited zoom capability, and manufacturers are looking into technological improvements that will let people take more photos in poorly lit conditions, like nightclubs.an exhibition next month in aid of the charity mencap, will feature snaps taken from the camera phones of top artists.but camera phone fears have not dampened the manufacturers' profits.over 60% of mobiles sold during the three months through to september featured integrated cameras, it said.
