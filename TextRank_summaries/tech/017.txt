the forum for the future research found that the low cost of these recycled handsets means they can have a very useful second life in poorer nations.the report reveals that approximately 15 million mobile phones go out of use every year in the uk.of the 15 million that are swapped for newer models each year, only 25% get returned to mobile phone firms for recycling or re use.the slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates james goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future.older mobile phones are proving particularly useful in poorer nations where people want to use a mobile and keep in touch with friends and family but do not have the income to buy the most up to date model.the forum for the future report took an in depth look at romania where reconditioned mobile phones were proving very popular.it's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network, said mr goodman, and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones.but the relatively low wages in romania, which is one of the poorest countries in europe, mean few people can afford a shiny new phone.mr goodman said phone operators and consumers needed to do more to ensure that more of britain's mobile mountain made it overseas.
