in london alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey.this has left londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec, a mobile data backup firm.more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities helsinki, oslo, munich, paris, stockholm, copenhagen, chicago and sydney where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out.given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around.you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.equally, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to.this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost.briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen.
