in fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing.figures gathered by continental research shows that 36% of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms , up from 7% in 2003.getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying.the problem they face, said shailendra jain, head of mms firm adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to.the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said mr jain.andrew bud, executive chairman of messaging firm mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant, he said.israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth.while not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content.as a result 40% of the subscribers to the hutch alive, which uses celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator.
