tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services.but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone.to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers.this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for.the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones.the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms.christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads.some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn.also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules.the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality, said mr flynn.
