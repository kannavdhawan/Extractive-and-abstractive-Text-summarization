have hackers recruited your pc more than one million computers on the net have been hijacked to attack websites and pump out spam and viruses.the huge number was revealed by security researchers who have spent months tracking more than 100 networks of remotely controlled machines.the detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work.while 'bot nets have been known about for some time, estimates of how widespread they are from security firms have varied widely.the longest time a honeynet machine survived without being found by an automatic attack tool was only a few minutes.the months of surveillance revealed that the different 'bot nets which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines are used for a variety of purposes.during the monitoring period, the team saw 'bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial of service attacks on 99 separate targets.using a 'bot net of machines spread around different networks and nations makes such attacks hard to defend against.criminals also seem to be starting to use 'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data.leveraging the power of several thousand bots, it is viable to take down almost any website or network instantly, said the researchers.
