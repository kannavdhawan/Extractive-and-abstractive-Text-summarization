but when high definition films do come out on the new format dvds, it will profoundly change home entertainment.for rick dean, director of business development for digital content company thx, a high definition future is an exciting prospect.he has worked on the star wars dvd trilogy, finding nemo, the incredibles and indiana jones.the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master, he says.but currently, putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand.i would love to be able to show people what projects that we worked on really look like in the high def world and i find it very exciting.high definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to.it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in 18 months' time.mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition , not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.high definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.on the whole, producing films for high definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.currently, an entire dvd project can take up to three months, says mr dean.on the fairly complex star wars disks, making sure the menu buttons worked took 45 human hours alone.and if studios do focus on delivering more added value content , thinks mr dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high definition dvd.high definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike.what high definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband , giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive, says mr dean.
