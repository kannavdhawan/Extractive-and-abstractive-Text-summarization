rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech savvy criminals.many extortionists are targeting net based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid.but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk's biggest net firms to stop these attacks.increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures.mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems.many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said mr king.malcolm seagrave, security expert at energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said mr seagrave.maria capella, spokeswoman for net provider pipex, said that when ddos attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days.the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites.we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack, said ms capella.this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult.also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.
