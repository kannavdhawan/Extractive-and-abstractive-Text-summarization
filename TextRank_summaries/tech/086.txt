warning over windows word files writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm workshare.sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said andrew pearson, european boss of workshare which commissioned the research.the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes.as documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents.microsoft, however, does provide an add on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem.often, said mr pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.the research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft.problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said mr pearson.
