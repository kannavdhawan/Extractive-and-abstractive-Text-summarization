but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design.inside that small box there is a g4 processor, a cd dvd player, a hard drive, some other technical bits and bobs and an operating system.the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd.it's a good little machine with a reasonable amount of power and just perfect for the average computer user who wants to leave the tyranny of window and viruses, said mark sparrow, technical and reviews editor at mac format magazine.the small size of the machine makes it a practical solution for in car entertainment playing movies and music as well as navigation.another user has mounted his mac mini to the back of his large plasma screen and then controls the computer via a wireless keyboard and mouse.when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes, music, films and photos partly due to its small, living room friendly design.but there are obvious reasons why this is not the case at least not in the here and now the hard drive at 80gb for the larger model is too small to be realistically used as media centre.a media centre computer has to store music, files and photos and as such 80gb just seems too small.coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not.but that has not stopped more enterprising users from adapting the mac mini to media centre uses.it's just a mac, but we should be very excited it's revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs , looks looks better than pcs , and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low cost pc market.
