by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says ian pearson, bt's resident futurologist.his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future.images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology.but now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics.so mp3 players the mass gadget of the moment will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says mr pearson.wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while video tattoos , or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as tv screens for those on the move.however, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions.if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says baroness susan greenfield.at a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the royal society in london, neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we can't just sleepwalk into the future .these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano and micro engineering the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale.at the nanoscale, materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems.the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways.but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being.if our clothing, skin, and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy.we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer by to know.as technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this, warns baroness greenfield.
