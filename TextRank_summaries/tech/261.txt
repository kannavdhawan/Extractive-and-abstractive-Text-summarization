speech takes on search engines a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.called speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results.scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november.the edinburgh based firm cec has married speech technology with ever popular internet search.we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the royal national institute of the blind rnib is looking at the technology, he added.but julie howell, digital policy manager at the rnib, expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web.the site uses a technology dubbed panavox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech.visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine google.google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said mr renton.
