concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned.already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system.todd thiemann, spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro, said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks.mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.incidents like this happen, said mr thiemann, because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system, he said.but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.windows cash machines have been around for several years, he said.risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.
