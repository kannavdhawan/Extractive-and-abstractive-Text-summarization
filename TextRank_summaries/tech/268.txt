ibm frees 500 software patents computer giant ibm says 500 of its software patents will be released into the open development community.ibm described the step as a new era in how it dealt with intellectual property and promised further patents would be made freely available.traditional technology business policy is to amass patents and despite ibm's announcement the company continues to follow this route.ibm was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, more than any other firm in the us, the new york times reports.for each of the past 12 years ibm has been granted more us patents than any other company.kelly, ibm senior vice president, technology and intellectual property, said true innovation leadership is about more than just the numbers of patents granted.our pledge today is the beginning of a new era in how ibm will manage intellectual property.in the past, ibm has supported the non commercial operating system linux although critics have said this was done only as an attempt to undermine microsoft.the company said it wanted to encourage other firms to release patents into what it called a patent commons .adam jollans, ibm's world wide linux strategy manager, said the move was a genuine attempt to encourage innovation.mr jollans likened the plan for a patent commons to the way the internet was developed and said everyone could take advantage of the result of collaboration.stuart cohen, chief executive of us firm open source development labs, said the move could mean a change in the way companies deal with patents.florian mueller, campaign manager of a group lobbying toprevent software patents becoming legal in the european union,dismissed ibm's move as insubstantial.
