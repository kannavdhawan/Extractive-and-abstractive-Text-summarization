blind student 'hears in colour' a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.victor wong, a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research.to study space weather mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models.mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.for the sake of my own study and for the sake of blind scientists generally i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.
