security scares spark browser fix microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech savvy criminals.test versions of the new program, called ie 7, are due to be released by the summer.the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates, microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco.in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6, microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware.one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti spyware program.the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u turn because, before now, microsoft said it had no need to update the browser.the current version of internet explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera.in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004.
