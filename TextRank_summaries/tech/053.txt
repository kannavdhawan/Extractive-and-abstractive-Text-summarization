the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003.the revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries.google still reigns supreme as the site people turn to most often when they go online to answer a query, keep up with news or search for images.but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as yahoo and microsoft, and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves.the microsoft search engine can also answer specific queries directly rather than send people to a page that might contain the answer.the test, or beta, version of the msn search engine unveiled in november had a few teething troubles.on its first day many new users keen to try it were greeted with a page that said the site had been overwhelmed.
