freeze on anti spam campaign a campaign by lycos europe to target spam related websites appears to have been put on hold.no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti spam campaign.lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites.the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack.lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold.the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, stay tuned .this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site.not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.
