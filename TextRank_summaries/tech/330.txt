eu software patent law faces axe the european parliament has thrown out a bill that would have allowed software to be patented.during consultation the software patents bill could be substantially re drafted or even scrapped.other proponents of the bill said it was a good compromise that avoided the excesses of the american system which allows the patenting of business practices as well as software.also earlier this month the influential european legal affairs committee juri said the law should be re drafted after it failed to win the support of meps.to become law both the european parliament and a qualified majority of eu states have to approve of the draft wording of the bill.
