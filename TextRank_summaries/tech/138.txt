fans of the software have banded together to raise cash to pay for an advert in the new york times announcing that version 1.0 of the browser is available.the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant's internet explorer browser.firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998.since then the software has been gaining praise and converts, not least because of the large number of security problems that have come to light in microsoft's internet explorer.rivals to ie got a boost in late june when two us computer security organisations warned people to avoid the microsoft program to avoid falling victim to a serious vulnerability.internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie.before july this year, according to websidestory, internet explorer was used by about 95% of web surfers.the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10% of the windows using, net browsing population.firefox is proving popular because, at the moment, it has far fewer security holes than internet explorer and has some innovations lacking in microsoft's program.the mozilla foundation is an open source organisation which means that the creators of the browser are happy for others to play around with the core code for the program.a campaign co ordinated by the spread firefox website attempted to raise the 50,000 needed for a full page advert in the new york times.
