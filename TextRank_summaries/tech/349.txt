as a telecoms company, bt is moving to a content distribution strategy, andrew burke, chief of bt's new entertainment unit told the iptv world forum.the bbc is also trialling a service to play programmes over the net and has not ruled out offering it to non licence fee payers overseas.we see several opportunities for delivering the type of content that normally broadcasters find it difficult to get to viewers, said bt's andrew burke.with more people on broadband, and connection speeds increasing, telcos around the world are looking for new ways to make money from it.it also sees delivering tv over broadband as a way of getting high definition hd content to people sooner than they will be able to get it through conventional, regular broadcasts.delivering programmes over broadband offers clear public value, says the bbc, because it gives people more control, and more choice.both use broadband net connections to carry information, like video and voice, in packets of data instead of conventional means.since it uses internet technology, iptv could mean more choice of programmes, more, more interactivity, tailored programming, and more localised content outside of conventional satellite, digital cable, and terrestrial broadcasts.it is all part of the larger changing tv technology landscape and, like personal digital video recorders pvrs , gives people much more control over tv.the bbc recognises that tv over broadband is a reality and aims to innovate with it, said rahul chakkara, controller of bbci's 24 7 interactive tv services.the imp is based on peer to peer technology, and lets people download programmes the bbc owns the rights to for up to seven days after broadcast.iptv enables us to take back that programme to our audience at different times, said mr chakkara.it helps, said mr burke, that people are more au fait with terms like digital , interactive , now that digital tv reaches more than 56% of uk homes.bt does not see itself as a broadcaster of iptv services, rather as an enabler , said mr burke.broadband to them would not be about data and the net that could come later for them but about cheap phone calls and more choice of tv programmes.
