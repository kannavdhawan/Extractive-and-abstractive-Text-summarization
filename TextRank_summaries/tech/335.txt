the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks.the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access , a high speed, high bandwidth technology available now.early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second mbps compared with less than 384 kilobits per second kbps on standard 3g networks.high speed downlink packet access hsdpa sometimes called super 3g will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips, according to a report published by uk based research consultancy analysys.motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device.but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised ev do .we are expanding our network and deploying ev do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds, said oliver valente, sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced.as part of 3bn in multi year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around 1bn on ev do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3 0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps.us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa, using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10.the speeds offered by 3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences.but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second much faster than 3g.
