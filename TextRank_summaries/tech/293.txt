file swappers ready new network legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.one site behind the success of the bittorrent file swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program.in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network.shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network.org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem.in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems.like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want.this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music.sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development.users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.dr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems.but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared.mr pouwelse said that future versions of file sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading.when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse.
