the court will decide whether producers of file sharing software can ultimately be held responsible for copyright infringement.they questioned if opening the way for the entertainment industry to sue file sharers could deter innovation.legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file trading firms into bankruptcy.but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus the file sharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file sharing providers.defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer to peer networks, upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case.the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past 20 years, said gary shapiro, chief executive of the consumer electronics association.he said that while file trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music, conceptually the technology had some really excellent uses .based on tuesday's hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy.cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year.they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs, file sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software, government documents and promotional copies of music.
