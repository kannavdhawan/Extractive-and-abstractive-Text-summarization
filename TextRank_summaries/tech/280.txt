cable offers video on demand cable firms ntl and telewest have both launched video on demand services as the battle between satellite and cable tv heats up.the service is similar to sky plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box yet.it allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over sky for the first time in many years, said telewest chief executive eric tveter.telewest customers in bristol and ntl viewers in glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental.telewest will launch similar services later in the year.the bbc is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their pc.for telewest it is the beginning of a 20m investment in tv on demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder pvr .satellite customers without pvr cannot pause, rewind or fast forward their programmes.with both services on offer from telewest, mr tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial tv but also gain a huge competitive advantage over sky.we offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video on demand and pvr, he said.ntl said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a pvr but for the moment is concentrating on video on demand.
