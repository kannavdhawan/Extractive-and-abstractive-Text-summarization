such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes.when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than 20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market.by september, the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.in may, bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so called local loop unbundling.the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes.with cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like.it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb megabits per second .and the major price fall means that, rather than just talk about it, companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt's exchanges.another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year.the biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512k.the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route.
