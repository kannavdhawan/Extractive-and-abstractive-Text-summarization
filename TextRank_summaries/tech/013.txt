the uk film council has awarded a contract worth 11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema aadc , who will set up the network of up to 250 screens.most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images.the new network will double the world's total of digital screens.fiona deans, associate director of aadc, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made there is no degradation in quality over time.the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films, documentaries and foreign language films.although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk, digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said ms deans.it can cost up to 1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films.with digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.
