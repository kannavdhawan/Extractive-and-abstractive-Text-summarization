and i can spend the day working with my girlfriend anne, a children's writer, at her house in cambridge, sharing her wireless network.we checked the cable modem and noticed that it had no power, and when she changed the power lead it sparked at her in a way which made it abundantly clear that it was never going to talk to the internet again.with no modem installed in her computer, she had to borrow internet access from friends or use the dial up connection on her daughter's laptop, so she had to choose between copying her files onto her usb memory card or accepting a slower and flakier net connection.she planned a trip to norfolk but did not check the weather because the only place she knows to look for weather information is the bbc website.but she did not, because having fast, always on, and easy access to the net has become part of the routine of her daily life, and when it was taken away it was too much effort to go back to the old ways of doing things.according to ofcom there were almost four million broadband users in the uk in april 2004, and numbers are climbing fast.dial up users are switching to broadband.my dad finally made the change earlier this month and new net users are selecting broadband from the start.more and more of these broadband users are beginning to mould their daily lives around the availability of broadband internet connections, and they too will find it difficult to cope if they cannot get online for any reason.people who have integrated net access into their daily lives tell their friends about it, and show off the cool stuff they can do.they encourage other people to get broadband so that they can share digital photos and do all of the other things that need fast and reliable connectivity.of course, broadband in the uk is laughably slow compared to other parts of the world.but speed is only a small part of the attraction of broadband, and when it comes to checking websites for film times, looking at weather forecasts, or all of the other small things that make a real difference to the routines and habits of our daily lives, even uk speeds are sufficient.
