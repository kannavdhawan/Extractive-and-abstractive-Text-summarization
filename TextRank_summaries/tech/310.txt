the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud.the voice features, based on ibm technology, are currently only available in the windows version.but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision.another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people.people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands free experience.around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone.
