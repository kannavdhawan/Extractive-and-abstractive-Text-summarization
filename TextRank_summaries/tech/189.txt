screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail.the net firm estimates that if enough people sign up and download the tool, spammers could end up paying to send out terabytes of data.by getting thousands of people to download and use the screensaver, lycos hopes to get spamming websites constantly running at almost full capacity.but, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day.lycos did not want to use e mail to fight back, said mr pollmann.the sites being targeted are those mentioned in spam e mail messages and which sell the goods and services on offer.to limit the chance of mistakes being made, lycos is using people to ensure that the sites are selling spam goods.as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said mr pollmann.users do not have to be registered users of lycos to download and use the screensaver.despite the soft launch, mr pollmann said that the screensaver had been downloaded more than 20,000 times in the last four days.
