inside your shiny new pc is an extra chip called the trusted platform module tpm that can be used for a range of hardware based security features.eventually the tpm will be built into the main processor itself, and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own, from mobile phones to tv set top boxes to children's toys.but for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware, providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them.and as part of a well designed network system, it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today.it might be password protected user accounts, data encryption programs or a firewall, but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processor.this is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password, but also because its more work for users, systems administrators and managers.at the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems.this provides file encryption, password management and identity protection, usually for business users who connect to company networks.this will include what microsoft, in a typical act of obscurantism, calls the next generation secure computing base , and it will give user level programs access to the trusted computing hardware.when that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities, and no doubt the windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall.because the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management drm systems more secure, this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music, movies and books that we have bought from them.apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management.once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law.one wonders whether hardware based drm will work for those who believe that locking down digital content is a bad idea, and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away.the efforts going into drm would be much better spent building efficient distribution services, finding business models that are based on trusting your customers, and offering high quality downloads at fair prices.we need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy today.
