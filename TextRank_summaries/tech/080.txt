new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions.critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation.in december, poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software.its ministers want to see the phrasing of the text of the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions changed so that it excludes software patenting.critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies.but supporters say current law does not let big companies protect inventions which they have spent years developing.
