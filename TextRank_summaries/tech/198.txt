by contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max's 3g phone simply get in the way, and i did not see much value in the paid for services, especially the limited web access.the videos of entertainment news, horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal, and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image, never mind micro tv.but just as the world wide web was the killer application that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3g adoption.but it goes deeper than that playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players.after all, why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want, whenever i want, streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts, something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag, available for other uses too.i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip , to do either audio or video streaming, and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip .i am even playing with internet telephony, despite my reservations, and i appear on go digital on the world service, streamed over the web each week.but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net based ip services.the 3g services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges.if i want fast access to my e mail i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network.the phone is a lot more, and it is as a combination of mini tv, personal communications device and music video player that it really works.there is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices, accessing a wide range of services over different networks.an mp3g player, anyone bill thompson is a regular commentator on the bbc world service programme go digital.
