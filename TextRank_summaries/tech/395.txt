cebit fever takes over hanover thousands of products and tens of thousands of visitors make cebit the place to be for technology lovers.hotels have been booked out for months local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists.one of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence.the entertainment pc is being billed as the replacement for dvd players, stereos, telephones and computers offering a one box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house.to show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype digital lifestyle home by german magazine computer reseller news.we wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes, said claudia neulling from the magazine.that pc provides home entertainment, movies or music.it can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a dvd player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back.convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer, said mark brailey, director of corporate marketing for intel.and if you would rather watch live tv than a downloaded movie nec is showing a phone, on sale in china, which can show analogue tv on its colour screen.i think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example said koji umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for nec.it is also compatible with nokia's new visual radio technology.most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market.portable media player firm creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio a system some hearing aids use.the benefits over conventional bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life, said riccardo de rinaldini, creative's european marketing manager.the firm has a prototype headset linked up to a zen micro player.
