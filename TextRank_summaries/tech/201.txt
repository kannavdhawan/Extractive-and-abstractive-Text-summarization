how to make a gigapixel picture the largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the netherlands.the finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras.the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot.the researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures.the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.he did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image, said jurgen den hartog, one of the tno researchers behind the project.the dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image.following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the tno team is considering creating a full 360 degree panoramic view of another dutch city, with even higher resolution.
