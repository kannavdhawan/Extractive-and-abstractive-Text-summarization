the developers behind the system claim it is a break through in the way data is monitored and stored.the system is a joint venture between security firm 3ami and storage specialists bridgehead software.bridgehead software has come up with techniques to prove, to a legal standard, that any stored file on a pc has not been tampered with.ironically the impetus for developing the system came as a result of the freedom of information act, which requires companies to store all data for a certain amount of time.the storage system has been incorporated into an application developed by security firm 3ami which allows every action on a computer to be logged.privacy advocates are concerned that monitoring at work is not only damaging to employee's privacy but also to the relationship between employers and their staff.people need to recognise that you are using a pc as a representative of a company and that employers have a legal requirement to store data, he added.
