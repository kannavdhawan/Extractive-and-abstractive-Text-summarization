the surround sound demo is unremarkable when heard on a multi speaker home cinema system but startling when emerging from a small mobile phone.british firm sonaptic is one of a number of companies to have developed 3d audio technology that emerges from stereo speakers.but sonaptic's managing director david monteith says his firm is the only company to offer positional 3d audio on a mobile.sonaptic has been working with japanese mobile network ntt docomo to set standards for 3d audio on mobile phones.in the last few months handsets from nec, fujitsu and mitsubishi have been released on to the japanese marker which have chips produced by yamaha and rohm with sonaptic's technology.the technology has been around on pcs and games consoles for some time but what we are doing is making it more efficient so it can go on a small consumer device like a mobile phone, said mr monteith.your brain uses certain bits of information which we are effectively synthesising on a mobile phone handset.sonaptic's audio processing algorithms mimic that 3d encoding, giving the impression that sound is coming from the left, right, and behind a listener when in fact it is coming from a single source.mr montieth says if the sound is off to one side it will get to one ear before the other if it is on the right it has to bend around your head to get to your left ear.sonaptic hopes the technology will have a big impact in the growing market of mobile gaming and music downloading.sonaptic offers its technology on a chip or in software and is about to release a new version which significantly improves the efficiency of the audio processing.it's important we only use 10 or 15% of the processor otherwise you won't be able to play a game on the handset, explained mr montieth.
