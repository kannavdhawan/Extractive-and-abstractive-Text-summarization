losing yourself in online gaming online role playing games are time consuming, but enthralling flights from reality.but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight and to offer a warning.an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair keep track of time, wrote travis anderson, in texas.some of the comments were humorous this game is so good i'm not going to get it, there's no way i could limit the hours i'd spend playing it, wrote charles macintyre, from england.but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg 'you need to get out more' could be the motto of any mmorpg.scare mongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices.gaming is like any other pastime it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.unfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make.however, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent.massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.the scope of these games like warcraft, everquest, ultima among others is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite.part of the problem is grinding by which gamers have to perform long winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure.e hayot, writing in the culture blogzine print culture, said recently i used to play the online role playing game everquest a lot.he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasn't that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much .you lie you don't go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching tv a good thing, presumably , he wrote, explaining how everquest took over his time.he quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than everquest.but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far.almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month.i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality, she said.another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game.i know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing warcraft.. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, i find myself longing to have the time to join them.i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years since that began, games have become more and more complex.i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.i play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but i don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.when you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.despite having little monetary value, the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily.perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality my advice to gaming widows is if you can't beat 'em, join 'em .for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.obsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality .obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem.the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7 30am till 5 pm.when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i'm trying not to spend so much time on there.i become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction.it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world.i can't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, i just know it i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games.seven years ago, i began playing ultima online.online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others.whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv.when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres.but somehow i found time to get out, even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning.on with the fun online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.the message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming sounds like there are some sad stories here and i can believe them all.i play alot of warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is.i think i'm obsessed with gaming in general, i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to, i'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united.i am obsessed with online role playing games.i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning.as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively.i know i play for to long but it's an obsession that i can't control.me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv, trying to 'frag' some individual.it's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life.great game having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking.but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment.most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, ultima online was the game, ahhhh them was the days lol
