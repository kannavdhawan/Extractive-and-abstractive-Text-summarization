search wars hit desktop pcs another front in the on going battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened.the move is in answer to google's release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs.the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google, aol, yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.john connors, microsoft's chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.we're going to have a heck of a great race in search between google, microsoft and yahoo, he said.microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals, many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users.on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find e mail messages, spreadsheets, text files and presentations.many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too.companies such as blinkx, copernic, enfish x1 technologies and x friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use.also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet.many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using.
