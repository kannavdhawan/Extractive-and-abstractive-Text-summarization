'no re draft' for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps.some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive .the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, computer implemented invention .if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament.but that will not guarantee that the directive will become law instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive.most eu legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the council of ministers before it becomes law.
