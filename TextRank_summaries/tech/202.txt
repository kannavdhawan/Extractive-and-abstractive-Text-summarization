a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs.for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133 hectare texas ranch.the live shot website behind the scheme already lets people practise shooting at targets via the internet.john underwood, the man behind the live shot website, said the idea for the remote control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site.mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.also needed is a fast net connection so remote hunters can quickly track and aim at passing game animals with the camera and rifle rig.in a statement the rspca said it had grave concerns about people being allowed to go online and remotely control a rifle.as such there was nothing to stop mr underwood letting people hunt unregulated imported animals and wild pigs.mr underwood also lets people come in person to the ranch to hunt and shoot game animals.
