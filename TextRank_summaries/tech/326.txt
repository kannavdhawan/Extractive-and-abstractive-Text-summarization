dvd copy protection strengthened dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current dvd ripping copying programs used to pirate dvds.macrovision said the new technology will work in nearly all current dvd players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard.the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against rent, rip and return where people would rent a dvd, copy it and then return the original.macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti copying measures.
