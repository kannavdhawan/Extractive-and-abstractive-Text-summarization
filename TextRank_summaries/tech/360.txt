confusion over high definition tv now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv, dvds, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets.in most corners of tv and technology industries, high definition hdtv is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour.but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street.the uk is the largest display market in europe, according to john binks, director of gfk, which monitors global consumer markets.but, he added of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the uk are capable of getting high definition.there are 74 different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd ready, according to alexander oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra.they may be fantastic quality tvs, but many do not have adaptors in them called dvi or hdmi high definition multimedia interface connectors which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images.part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street, say industry experts, who gathered at bafta in london for the 2nd european hdtv summit last week.bskyb plans to ship its first generation set top boxes, to receive hdtv broadcasts, in time for christmas.but the set top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display tv set that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands, if hdtv is to be real .as a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a hd forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other.from next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a hd ready sticker.the european broadcast union ebu is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line.it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats, as well as which devices will support the formats.lcd prices dropped by 43% in europe as a whole last year, according to mr oudendijk.
