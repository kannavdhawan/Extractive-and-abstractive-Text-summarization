recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom.games teach life skills such as decision making, problem solving, said martin owen, at futurelab.mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error.learning games were somewhat old fashioned and we didn't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do, said dr carl gavin, managing director of lateral visions.the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element.we are keen to find out whether alongside learning a game, we can also learn something that the rest of the world can understand as being educational, said mr owen.this fusion of chatrooms and gaming is of special interest to futurelab as it is through talking to others that much of the learning can be achieved, thinks mr owen.pupils used the statistics to work out the best way to build their cars and the online message board to share ideas and support each other, said ben williamson, a researcher at futurelab charged with testing the game in real schools.dr gavin thinks the game satisfies both teachers' need for learning outcomes and the children's desire to rise to a challenge.games in the classroom need to support the teacher.'lite' versions of existing games could be the way forward and would overcome one of the biggest hurdles persuading developers to write for the educational market.already there are games on the market, such as civilisation and age of empire, that have educational elements said mr owen.
