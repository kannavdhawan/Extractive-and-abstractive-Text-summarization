the release of the tiny, low cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market.mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers.they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy to use and administer second home computer.mr evans said the combination of low cost, small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success.apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans, he said.the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said.apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac, he said.but, he said, the mac mini changed that perception.it's a particularly good price when you see that it's apple that is doing it, he said.for consumers interested in style, design and small size which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in it's a natural next step, said mr fogg.apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at, said mr fogg, who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor.they'd be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost, he said.those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said mr fogg.the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet, he said.since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long, slow decline, he said.the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.
