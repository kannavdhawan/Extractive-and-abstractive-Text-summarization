online commons to spark debate online communities set up by the uk government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the institute of public policy research ippr .although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online commons for public debate.in its report, is online community a policy tool , the ippr also asks if id cards could help create safer online communities.adopting an ebay type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection.what we are proposing is a civic commons, will davies, senior research fellow at the ippr told the bbc news website.it mentions good practice public initiatives like the bbc's ican project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues.but he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too.this could mean a civic commons would work within a non market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly recognised rules.with 53% of uk households now with access to the net, the government, suggests mr davies, could act as an intermediary or middleman to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more cosmopolitan politics and public trust in policy.but it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic, non market interactions, said mr davies.
