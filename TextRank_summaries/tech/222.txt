media gadgets get moving pocket sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts.but this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them.archos launched its latest range of its linux based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday.archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people's pockets, after the mobile.unlike windows based players, the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as tvs, as well as playback.microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces, primarily for us consumers though.the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows based portable media players or smartphones.it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central, vh1 and country music tv on its devices.and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices.but the ability to record directly from tv, vcr, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which windows based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.the increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them.but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi fi enabled.the possibility is open for non professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work.
