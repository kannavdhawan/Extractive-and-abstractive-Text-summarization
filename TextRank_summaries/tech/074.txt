china 'to overtake us net use' the chinese net using population looks set to exceed that of the us in less than three years, says a report.the report says that the country's culture will mean that chinese people will use the net for very different ends than in many other nations.already net use in china has a very different character than in many western nations, said william makower, chief executive of panlogic.net usage tends to happen in the evening, said mr makower, they get access only when they go home and go off to the internet caf .the net is key to helping chinese people keep in touch with friends, said mr makower.many people use it in preference to the phone or arrange to meet up with friends at net cafes.for instance, said mr makower, credit cards are rare in china partly because of fears people have about getting in to debt.the arrival of foreign banks in china, due in 2006, could mean greater use of credit cards but for the moment they are rare, said mr makower.but if chinese people are not spending cash online they are interested in the news they can get via the net and the view it gives them on western ways of living.government restrictions on how much advertising can appear on television means that the net is a source of many commercial messages chinese people would not see anywhere else.
