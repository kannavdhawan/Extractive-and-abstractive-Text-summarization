'brainwave' cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes.previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain.the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions, said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane.the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.although the two partially paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated.
