cyber criminals step up the pace so called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.the number of phishing e mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.in its end of year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals.in september 2003, messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations.but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e mail messages per month.older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber criminals and vandals.
