video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language bsl could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter.the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid , but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets.the rnid is urging telecoms regulator, ofcom, to reduce the cost of the service from the current 7.00 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls.the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language.the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call.in the us and australia, sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call.mr currington, like many of the uk's 70,000 bsl users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost effective service available.the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure, he said.
