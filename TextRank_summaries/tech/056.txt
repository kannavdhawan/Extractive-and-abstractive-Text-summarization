sporting rivals go to extra time the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on field action without ever moving from the couch.but that status quo was changed forever or for the next 15 years at least by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.it was a massive money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters, with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree.so, will the sega espn range be missed a key reason for answering yes is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste, and having some options available always proves hugely handy.on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements.the espn games are a touch more arcade like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly extensive array of in game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die hard of sports fans.they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable, and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways.what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv.
