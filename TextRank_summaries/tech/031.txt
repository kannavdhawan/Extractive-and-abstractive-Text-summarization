solutions to net security fears fake bank e mails, or phishing, and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e business experts.almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people.the survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online.more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm rsa, which carried out the poll.ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said.one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity.several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget.in a separate survey by rsa, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems.for many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.activcard is just one of the many companies, like rsa security, which has been trying to come up with just that.rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service.many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already.the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time.it combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions.the code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key.it means that in a typical security attack, explains mr ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode.by the time they go back to use the information , the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are, according to mr ash.the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around, he said.
