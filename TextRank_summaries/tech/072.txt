gadget growth fuels eco concerns technology firms and gadget lovers are being urged to think more about the environment when buying and disposing of the latest hi tech products.at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier this month, several hi tech firms were recognised for their strategies to help the environment.but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient, said the us environmental protection agency epa .ebay's initiative pulls together major technology firms, environment groups, government agencies and ebay users to give information about what to do with old computers and where to send them.we really became aware of the e waste issue and we saw that our 125 million users can be a powerful force for good, ebay's david stern told the bbc news website.the initiative, which was also launched at ces, rewards 10 to 28 year olds for returning unused phones.this system allows for the transformation of a drawer full of unused mobile phones into anything from music to clothes to electronics or games, said seth heine from ripmobile.mr heine told the bbc news website that what was important was to raise awareness amongst the young so that recycling becomes learned behaviour .there is more and more awareness on the consumer side, but the whole industry is moving towards being lead free, intel's allen wilson told the bbc news website.the predicted huge growth in the gadget market means the amount of energy used to power them up is on the rise too.although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves, the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.on 1 january, new efficiency standards for external power supplies came into effect as part of the european commission code of conduct.but at ces, the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters.these map out the framework for developing better adaptors that can be labelled with an energy star logo, meaning they are about 35% more efficient.we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat, hi tech devices, but also bundle with it a hi tech, efficient power supply, the epa's andrew fanara said.initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now, consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40% of electricity used in us homes, said the epa.
