game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.experts said the success of the half life 2 anti piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.half life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies.some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account.in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false.before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.but with this, valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half life 2, he said.if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems.
