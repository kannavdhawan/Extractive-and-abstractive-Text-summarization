the pirates with no profit motive two men who were part of a huge network of internet software pirates, known as drink or die, have been convicted at the old bailey.bbc news investigates how the network worked and what motivated those involved.they were a network of computer buffs who derived pleasure from cracking codes protecting copyrighted software such as windows 95.but the authorities in both britain and the united states considered it software piracy and took a dim view of networks such as dod, one of a number of so called warez organisations operating on the internet.among the leaders of the network were americans john sankus known by his internet nickname eriflleh hellfire spelt backwards richard berry, kent kartadinata and christopher tresco, who used a server based at the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology mit .us attorney paul mcnulty said at the time john sankus and his techno gang operated in the faceless world of the internet and thought they would never be caught.us customs claimed mr griffiths was one of dod's leaders but his lawyer, antony townsden, told the bbc news website it was a laughable suggestion and added he was living on welfare and had such an old computer that he couldn't even download software.he had the least technical skills of anyone, he couldn't crack any codes and he has only been called a leader because he was a loudmouth who wrote a lot on their messageboard.a spokesman for us immigration, customs and enforcement, dean boyd, said dod did not appear to be motivated by money.he told the bbc news website primarily they were just interested in how fast they could crack the code.but mr boyd pointed out that once the software had been distributed on the internet it fell into the hands of organised criminals who were able to mass produce pirated software at zero cost.warez groups, which began to surface in the early 1990s, operate according to a strict code of honour.for example if one group cracked the software first its rivals would respect that achievement and not seek to claim it themselves.mr boyd said the destruction of dod was a great coup but he added i'm not going to sit here and say we have sorted the problem.internet piracy of computer software remains a gigantic problem.a spokesman for the business software alliance said dod members claim they did not profit at all.he said dod and other warez groups were fostering a culture of piracy on the internet.he said 29% of computer software in britain was believed to have been pirated and this cost 1bn in revenue for software companies, their suppliers and distributors.
