smart search lets art fans browse if you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting.artgarden, developed by bt's research unit, is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings.rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures.it 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them.a variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck.the text based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful.the tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as artgarden can help with that, said ms rellie.bt research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.
