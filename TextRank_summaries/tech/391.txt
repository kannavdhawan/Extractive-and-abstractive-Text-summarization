peer to peer nets 'here to stay' peer to peer p2p networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology.since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks.once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology, the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business.in august 2004, the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast, two file sharing networks.p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them.the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month, and about half a million films are downloaded a day.legal music download services, like apple itunes, napster, have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content.we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p, said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer.but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned.once some of these issues are resolved, you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content, but also in ways that are unimaginable now, he said.
