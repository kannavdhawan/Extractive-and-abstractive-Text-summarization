attack prompts bush site block the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons .many have found that the site can still be viewed by overseas browsers via several alternative net addresses.the policy of trying to stop overseas visitors viewing the site is thought to have been adopted in response to an attack on the georgewbush.in early october a so called denial of service attack was mounted on the site that bombarded it with data from thousands of pcs.about the same time the web team of the bush cheney campaign started using the services of a company called akamai that helps websites deal with the ebbs and flows of visitor traffic.akamai uses a web based tool called edgescape that lets its customers work out where visitors are based.there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site.com was spotted by net monitoring firm netcraft which keeps an eye on traffic patterns across many different sites.netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney have failed.by contrast netcraft's four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems.data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack.managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign.
