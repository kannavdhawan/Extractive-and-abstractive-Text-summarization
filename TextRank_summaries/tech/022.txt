sun offers processing by the hour sun microsystems has launched a pay as you go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.sun grid costs users 1 53p for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun.the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz.although it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost 12 6.30 because it had used up 12 hour's worth of computing power.it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm, which argues that its capacity on demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.
