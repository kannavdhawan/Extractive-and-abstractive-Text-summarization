intel unveils laser breakthrough intel has unveiled research that could mean data is soon being moved around chips at the speed of light.scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light.currently, says dr paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables.dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material.but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light.the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it.dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.
