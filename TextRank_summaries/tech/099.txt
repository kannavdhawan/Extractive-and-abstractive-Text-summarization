but this year the focus has been on blogs which cast a critical eye over news events, often writing about issues ignored by the big media or offering an eye witness account of events.there are already websites pulling together these first hand reporting accounts heralded by blogs, like wikinews.andrew nachison, director of the media center, a us based think tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs.mr nachison argues blogs have become independent sources for images and ideas that circumvent traditional sources of news and information such as newspapers, tv and radio.we have to acknowledge that in all of these cases, mainstream media actually plays a role in the discussion and the distribution of these ideas, he told the bbc news website.some parts of the so called traditional media have expressed concerns about this emerging competitor, raising questions about the journalistic value of blogs.however, he agrees with other experts like the linguist and political analyst noam chomsky, that mainstream media has lost the traditional role of news gatekeeper.with people now walking around with information devices in their pockets, like camera or video phones, we are going to see more instances of ordinary citizens breaking stories.but the current number of blogs is likely to keep on growing, in a web already overloaded with information.tools such as google's blogger, movabletype and the recently launched beta version of msn spaces are making it easier to run a blog.but experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay.we are entering one era in which the technological infrastructure is creating a different context for how we tell our stories and how we communicate with each other, said mr nachison.
