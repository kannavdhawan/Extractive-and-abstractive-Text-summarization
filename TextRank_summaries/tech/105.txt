a spokesman for the international atomic energy agency iaea said its current technology could allow key information to be overlooked as it was more than 20 years old.a major overhaul of the system is needed to allow inspectors immediate, secure online access to information, said project manager livio costantini.iaea inspectors make around 3,000 visits a year to more than 900 nuclear facilities worldwide.they are there to verify official reports of activities in the plants, to carry out environmental checks, and also to look for any signs that nuclear material is being smuggled in or out of the facility.the organisation is aiming to start a system upgrade in november, aiming to provide inspectors in the field with secure online access to previous inspection data, design blueprints of nuclear facilities, even satellite images of the plant.the iaea estimates the total cost of the four year project to upgrade its technology will be 40m.failure to replace the hardware and software, and to integrate fully all the information system components will carry large risks, said an agency statement.
