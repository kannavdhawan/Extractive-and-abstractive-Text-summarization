global blogger action day called the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers.the month old committee to protect bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 february to the free mojtaba and arash day .blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions.i hope this day will focus people, curt hopkins, director of the committee, told the bbc news website.the committee has deemed tuesday free mojtaba and arash day as part of its first campaign.it is calling on the blogsphere the name for the worldwide community of bloggers to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other cyber dissidents .if you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'free mojtaba and arash day', said mr hopkins.the committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non for profit organisation.people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view, said mr hopkins.it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers.high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said mr hopkins, is part of the whole messy conversation.mr hopkins said that the blogsphere which is doubling every five months was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog.many companies offer easy to use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community.
