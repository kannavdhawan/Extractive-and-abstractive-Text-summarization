rolling out next generation's net the body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start.in a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population, the new chair of the internet engineering task force ietf , brian carpenter, says.with broadband take up growing, services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net.i think voip voice over internet protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the net is very important it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms, says dr carpenter.as the new chair of the ietf, his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web.at cern, dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well placed to take on such a task.the net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf.the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.the ietf is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net's architecture and the way this information is sent and received.that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like china, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies.the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate, explained dr carpenter.given it the net was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions.ipv6, the standard that will replace the existing ipv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world.that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of ip ipv6.standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task.the difference this next generation standard, ipv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible.technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said dr carpenter.we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards.
