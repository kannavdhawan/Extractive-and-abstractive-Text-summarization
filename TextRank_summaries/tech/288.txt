big war games battle it out the arrival of new titles in the popular medal of honor and call of duty franchises leaves fans of wartime battle titles spoilt for choice.the acclaimed pc title call of duty has been updated for console formats, building on many of the original's elements.for its part, the long running medal of honor series has added pacific assault to its pc catalogue, adapting the console game rising sun.call of duty finest hour casts you as a succession of allied soldiers fighting on world war 2 battlefronts including russia and north africa.it is a traditional first person viewed game that lets you control just one character, in the midst of a unit where cohorts constantly bark orders at you.on a near identical note, medal of honor pacific assault does all it can to make you feel part of a tight knit team and plum in the middle of all out action.a winning moment is an early scene in pacific assault, where you come under attack at the famous us base in hawaii.this notion of shuffling the player along a studiously pre determined path, forcibly witnessing a series of pre set moments of action, is a perilous business which can make the whole affair feel stilted rather than organic.letting you play a number of different roles is an interesting ploy that adds new dimensions to the call of duty endeavour, even if it sacrifices the narrative flow somewhat.the game's drawback could be said to be its format tastes differ, but these wartime shooters often do seem to work better on pc.call of duty on pc was more detailed, plot wise and graphically, and this new adaptation feels a little rough and ready.of the two games, pacific assault gets more things right, including little points like auto saving intelligently and having tidier presentation.finest hour is by no means bad, and it is only because the pc original was so dazzling that this version sometimes feels underwhelming.those looking for a wartime game with plenty of atmosphere and a hearty abundance of enemies to shoot will be contented.
