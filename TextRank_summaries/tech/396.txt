new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.in a pre recorded video slot during microsoft's keynote address at the game developers conference, held last week in san francisco, famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita.but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop.according to robert walsh, head of brisbane based game developer krome studios, next generation games will cost between 10 25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title.such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said mr walsh.mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright, the creator of the best selling the sims games.starting with an amoeba sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game.few games have hinted at the scope of spore, but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers.instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures, spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers.the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market, said mr wright.new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.its latest tool, gencrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo realistic human faces for games involving lots of people.one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games.even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.the game developers conference included a special two day summit dedicated to creating mobile games.mobile games are a fast growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games.the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game, created by ea mobile's 30 person development team.mr batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony's upcoming psp handheld console.
