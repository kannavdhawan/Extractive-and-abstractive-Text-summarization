after years of buzz about high definition tv hdtv it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the us and japan.all television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down.but to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them.viewers in japan, the us, australia, canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye blasting high definition images.many high end european tv programmes, such as the recent athens olympics, are already being produced in high definition.according to consultants strategy analytics, only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high definition by 2008.the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast in high definition.in the uk, satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006.in britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options.the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming, says andy quested, from the bbc's high definition support group.one of the options under consideration is to offer high definition pictures on the web.according to mr quested, this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv.
