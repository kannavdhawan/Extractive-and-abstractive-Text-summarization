format wars could 'confuse users' technology firms sony, philips, matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats.in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content .the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought.the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft.confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past, said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.it's not a two horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own.shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying, he said.instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers.
