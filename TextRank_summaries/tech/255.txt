hollywood campaign hits websites movie studio efforts to stop pirated films being shared on peer to peer networks have claimed a high profile victim.the campaign of legal action is thought to be behind the closure of the widely used suprnova.the site is thought to have closed following an announcement by the motion picture association of america that it was launching legal action against those operating bittorrent servers rather than end users.because of the way that bittorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it.in the opening days of the mpaa campaign, the organisation filed 100 lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server site.phoenix torrents, another popular bittorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action.
