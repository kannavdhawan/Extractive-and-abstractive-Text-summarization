looks and music to drive mobiles mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts gartner.good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts.although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow down in replacement sales.all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe, mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website.but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology.this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner.third generation mobiles 3g with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen.more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services.western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design, said ms milanesi.sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera.ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives.
