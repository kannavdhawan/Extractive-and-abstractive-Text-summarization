satellite mapping aids darfur relief aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the sudanese region of darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.a european consortium of companies and university groups known as respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps.respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large scale maps useful for very general planning purposes, said einar bjorgo from unosat, the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium.you have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps, said stefan voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the german aerospace centre.humanitarian groups in darfur have been making good use of respond's maps.these wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground, says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit.respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times.aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on the ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.
