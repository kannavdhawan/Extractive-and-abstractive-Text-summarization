'evil twin' fear for wireless net people using wireless high speed net wi fi are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points.the latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say cranfield university experts.users need to be wary of using their wi fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature, said professor brian collins, head of information systems at cranfield university.naturally, people may have security concerns, said chris clark, chief executive for bt's wireless broadband.this means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure, said mr clark.cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack, said dr phil nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield.because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.although wi fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is.public wi fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use.we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted.
