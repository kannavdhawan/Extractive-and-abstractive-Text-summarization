apple, which opened its online store in 2003 after launching the ipod in 2001, uses technology to ensure each song bought only plays on the ipod.the key to such a lawsuit would be convincing a court that a single brand like itunes is a market in itself separate from the rest of the online music market, according to ernest gellhorn, an anti trust law professor at george mason university.apple has sold more than six million ipods since the gadget was launched and has an 87% share of the market for portable digital music players, market research firm npd group has reported.more than 200 million songs have been sold by the itunes music store since it was launched.apple has unlawfully bundled, tied, and or leveraged its monopoly in the market for the sale of legal online digital music recordings to thwart competition in the separate market for portable hard drive digital music players, and vice versa, the lawsuit said.apple's online music store uses a different format for songs than napster, musicmatch, realplayer and others.
