yahoo moves into desktop search internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e mail and other files on their pcs.the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft, google and ask jeeves, which have offered similar services.yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files.it doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web based and desktop data.we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content, said julian smith, an analyst with research firm jupiter.it is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well, he said.desktop search is just one of many features people would like but i'm suspicious of its usefulness, he said.more useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said.
