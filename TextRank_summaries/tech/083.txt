microsoft makes anti piracy move microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs.either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft's site.those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and add ons that the software giant offers.people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating pcs.it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net, he said.the scheme meant that anyone with pre installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free.
