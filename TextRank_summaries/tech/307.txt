bill thompson thinks it's about time.chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too, reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways.apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents.one of the key aspects of the new approach is to design products that are easier to recycle.this is going to be very important to hardware manufacturers in europe since from august the new waste electronic and electrical equipment directive will oblige them to accept returned products for recycling.we're seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come.if apple gets its way then a lot of people are going to be buying a new mac mini and throwing away their old pc, keeping the monitor and other peripherals.but what do we do with the old ones i've just looked around my office and i find two monitors, an old 386 pc, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use.they are all old enough to be hazardous waste the monitors alone will be full of arsenic and lead but it's possible that some of the components could be useful.would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i'd probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box at least eventually.
