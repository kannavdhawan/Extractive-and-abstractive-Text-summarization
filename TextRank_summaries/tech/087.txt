net regulation 'still possible' the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog ofcom has said.despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option.at the debate, organised by the internet service providers' association ispa , lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web.in fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free.internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002.huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net.the bbc's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.as inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan, liberal democrat spokesman on it.
