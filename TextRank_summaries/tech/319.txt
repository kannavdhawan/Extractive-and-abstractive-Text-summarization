sony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms.traditional computers whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer.the cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place.both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as pcs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack.sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market.by creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals.sony hopes to put cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip.each cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power.you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight.intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop pc dominance.if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump start to the fully digital home of the future.
