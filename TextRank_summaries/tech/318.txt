the bloglines site has become hugely popular as it gives users one place in which to read, search and share all the blogs they are interested in.bloglines has become popular because it lets users build a list of the blogs they want to follow without having to visit each journal site individually.to do this it makes use of a technology known as really simple syndication rss that many blogs have adopted to let other sites know when new entries are made on their journals.jim lanzone, vice president of search properties at ask jeeves in the us, said it did not acquire bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world.mr lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with ask's my jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.search engines are about discovering information for the first time and rss is the ideal way to keep track of and monitor those sites, he said.it would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that ask jeeves operates.though mr lanzone added that ask jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.
