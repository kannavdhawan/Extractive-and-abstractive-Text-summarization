apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products, including the mac mini.the eff, representing the reporters, has asked california's superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources.apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code named asteroid and has asked the journalists' e mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that.rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head on, apple is going to the journalist's isps for his e mails, said eff lawyer kurt opsahl.if the court lets apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary, he said.the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.
