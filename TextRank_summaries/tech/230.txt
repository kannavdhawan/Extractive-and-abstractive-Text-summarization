when interrogated with a mobile phone, the posters pass on a number that people can call to get information about the safest route home.sited at busy underground stations, the posters are fitted with an infra red port that can beam information directly to a handset.nigel marson, head of group marketing at transport for london tfl , said the posters were useful because they work outside the mobile phone networks.we started with infra red because there are a huge number ir phones out there, said rachel harker, spokeswoman for hypertag which makes the technology fitted to the posters.although the hypertags in the posters only pass on a phone number, ms harker said they can pass on almost any form of data including images, ring tones and video clips.she said that there are no figures for how many people are using the posters but a previous campaign run for a cosmetics firm racked up 12,500 interactions.
