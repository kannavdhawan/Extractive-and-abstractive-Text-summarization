napster offers rented music to go music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle either single tracks or subscriptions services, said paul myers, chief executive of wippit, a uk based music download service.the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service.this has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc.we've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want.who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an ipod or the latest mobile phone wippit offers a download subscription service for 4.99 per month or 50 per year.
