a windows virus called bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code.those clicking on the poisoned links in e mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus.essentially, bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus.filtering firm clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down.in the past other malicious programs have relied on a single web server that downloads viral code to target machines.clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e mail messages sent out by machines infected by bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread.finnish anti virus firm f secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the bofra virus and its variants in circulation.most firms have secured their e mail gateway, said mr warner, but the irony is that most of them let malicious content through the web gateways.the bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug, can infect machines running windows 2000, 95, 98, me, nt, xp and server 2003.
