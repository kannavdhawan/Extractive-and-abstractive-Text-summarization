lifestyle 'governs mobile choice' faster, better or funkier hardware alone is not going to help phone firms sell more handsets, research suggests.historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology, said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.for the study, ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.ericsson's research has shown that consumers divide into different tribes that use phones in different ways.dr bjorn said groups dubbed pioneers and materialists were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.only when about 25% of people have handsets with new innovations on them, such as cameras, can consumers stop worrying that if they send a picture message the person at the other end will be able to see it.once this significant number of users is passed, use of new innovations tends to take off.however, he said, now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month.similarly, across europe the numbers of people taking snaps with cameras is starting to rise.dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.
