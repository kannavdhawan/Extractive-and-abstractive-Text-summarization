bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans, the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour.adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game, for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original's massive sense of fun.rogue agent signals its intentions by featuring james bond initially and proceeding to kill him off within moments, squashed by a plummeting helicopter.the notion is of course to add a novel dark edge to a 007 game, but the premise simply does not get the juices flowing like it needs to.recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair, invention and glamour of the film franchise.this title lacks that aura, and when the bond magic shines through, it feels like a lucky accident.sadly that sense of action is outweighed by the difficulty of navigating and battling within the chaos, meaning that frustration is often the outcome.it is perhaps indicative of a lack of confidence that the game maker's allow you several different weapons almost immediately and throw you quickly into raging firefights no time is risked with a measured build up.diehard fans of bond will probably find enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase and try to ignore the failings.given james bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return.goldeneye rogue agent is out now
