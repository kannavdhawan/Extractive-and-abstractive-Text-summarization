a decade of good website design the web looks very different today than it did 10 years ago.but, says usability guru dr jakob nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use.dr nielsen has looked back at a decade of work on usability and considered whether the 34 core guidelines drawn up back then are relevant to the web of today.roughly 80% of the things we found 10 years ago are still an issue today, he said.dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever.a lot of people thought that design and usability was only a temporary problem because broadband was taking off, he said.dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google, amazon, ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important.all are based on user empowerment and make it easy for people to do things on the internet, he said.often people had to look at a website just to judge whether it was useful or not.research by dr nielsen shows that people are getting more sophisticated in their use of search engines.the latest statistics on how many words people use on search engines shows that, on average, they use 2.2 terms.
