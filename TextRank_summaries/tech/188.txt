call for action on internet scam phone companies are not doing enough to warn customers about internet rogue dialling scams, according to premium phone line regulator icstis.it has received 45,000 complaints in recent months about dial up internet connections diverting to premium rate numbers without users' knowledge.phone companies refuse to pay compensation because they say calls must be paid for.people who use dial up connections can be affected by the scams.without realising, a program can be downloaded which diverts internet calls via a premium phone line.icstis spokesman rob dwight said phone companies should get in touch with their customers sooner.phone companies had the systems in place to spot fraudulent activity and artificially inflated traffic, he said.the biggest phone company bt says it is doing what it can to monitor fraud and warn people about rogue dialling.its advice to customers is to use call barring if they want to prevent calls to premium lines because, under the current system, once the call has been made there's little that can be done.the government has ordered a review of premium line services and is likely to say icstis should have more power to deal with rogue diallers in future.does any one know what happens once this fraud has been committed and recognised the phone companies pay the people who obtaining money fraudulently, so are these people followed up and prosecuted these diallers are mainly downloaded from sites offering illegal mp3s, porn and pirated software.these scams are illegal and telephone companies should have nothing to do with them.or are they themselves receiving such good returns that it is in their interest to keep the scam going why don't bt et al block all premium numbers by default and only turn it off at the customer's request to anyone who falls foul of this scam refuse to pay your telephone provider for these calls.no customers have yet been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills.he informed the phone company about it, they subsequently put a block on premium rate numbers.phone companies are probably quite happy for their customers to be hit with a huge bill, otherwise they'd be taking extra steps to prevent this kind of problem.premium rate numbers have been subject to various scams ever since they were invented.one example was where thieves would set up a premium rate number and then dial it day and night from phones whose quarterly bills were never paid.the telephone company was the victim here and you can bet that loophole was blocked very quickly.it's not the fault of phone companies, and at last they are doing something about it.it's about time that the profiteering by the 'legitimate' phone companies came to an end, mainly by doing away with dial up altogether and bring broadband down to the same price as dial up not only will this ruin things for the dialler scammers but also allow people to update and upgrade their security more easily and quickly.i haven't fallen victim to a rogue dialling scam but i think you're seriously remiss in not pointing out that the vast majority of these scams arise from people trying to access services purporting to provide free pornography.how about an automatic monthly cap of say 20 on premium rate calls that you would have to contact your provider to have lifted that way you could use legitimate premium rate numbers while limiting fraudulent usage.how about home users take some responsibility and ensure their anti virus and firewall software is up to date that should prevent the vast majority of these scams.
