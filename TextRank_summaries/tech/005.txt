technology gets the creative bug the hi tech and the arts worlds have for some time danced around each other and offered creative and technical help when required.but that dance is growing more intimate as hi tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration.the idea, says bt, is to shape a 21st century model which will help cement the art, technology, and business worlds together.we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology, said frank stone, head of the bt's business sector programmes.they have both been created using the telco's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm, including a sophisticated graphics rendering program.using a 3d graphics engine, the type commonly used in gaming, bafta winning artists langlands bell have created a virtual, story based, 3d model of brussels' coudenberg cellars.they are so time consuming and expensive to create, the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics intensive games.because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds, new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets.as more tools for self expression are given to the person on the street, enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance, creativity will become an integral part of technology.the orange expressionist exhibition last year, for example, displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation.the art world is fantastically rich , said mr stone, with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them.the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net, according to mr stone.with broadband penetration reaching 100% in the uk, businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it.we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy, said mr stone.
