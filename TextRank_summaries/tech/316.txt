more women turn to net security older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two year study.the number of women buying programs to protect pcs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004.it is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired.the research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers.the study predicts that 40% of all home pc net security buyers will be women in 2005.but net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said.programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial up users with a slower connection too, said mr goosens.more than 30,000 pcs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from symantec showed last year.the research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said mr goosens, they are reported in the press much more.by the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of uk homes will have broadband net access.in july last year, the number of uk households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial up for the first time, according to the office of national statistics.
