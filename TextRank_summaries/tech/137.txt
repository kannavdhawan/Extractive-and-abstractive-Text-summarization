when invention turns to innovation it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially.but, says nick donofrio, senior vice president of technology and manufacturing at ibm, it was not the thing itself that actually improved people's lives.the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access.when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster, mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture.the invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had.but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues mr donofrio, industry week's 2003 technology leader of the year.the hype and over promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be in your face .i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure, says mr donofrio.people will know their lives are just better, says mr donofrio.trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know.ultimately, there will be, says mr donofrio, no value in being computer illiterate .behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and deep computing , says mr donofrio.but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world.i am confident that the set science, engineering and technology industry is going to be short on skills, he says.eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says.
