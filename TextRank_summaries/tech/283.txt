games help you 'learn and play' 'god games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research.a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages.ravi purushotma believes that the world of the sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods.the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said mr purushotma.but instead of fearing computer games, ravi purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games.the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity, he said.by contrast, said mr purushotma, learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all.the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said mr purushotma.for instance, he said, in a version of the sims adapted to teach german, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning.one of the drawbacks of the sims, said mr purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation.although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.
