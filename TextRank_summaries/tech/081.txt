the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine.almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden.according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt.a significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks.according to pew research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites.tony macklin, spokesman for ask jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query.of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search.said the pew report this finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results.
