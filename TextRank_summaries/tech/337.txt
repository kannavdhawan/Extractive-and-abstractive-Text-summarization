for many, yahoo remains synonymous with the internet a veteran that managed to ride the dot com wave and the subsequent crash and maintain itself as one of the web's top brands.the veteran and the upstart have plenty in common yahoo was the first internet firm to offer initial public shares and google was arguably the most watched ipo initial public offering of the post dot com era.both began life as search engines although in 2000, when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business, it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention.yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google, he said they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor, he added.he believes yahoo failed to see how crucial search would become to internet users, something it has rediscovered in recent years.but for allen weiner, a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo's progress since the early years, the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it.he believes the rivalry between google and yahoo is overblown and instead thinks the real battle is going to be between yahoo and msn.i believe yahoo is the seminal brand on the web.if you are looking for a text book definition of web portal then yahoo is it, he said.so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor, how will it fare as it enters its teenage years the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo's domination, predicted mr weiner.mr weiner thinks yahoo's vision of becoming the ultimate gateway to the web will move increasing towards movies and television as more and more people get broadband access.
