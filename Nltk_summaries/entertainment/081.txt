the 30 year old actor, who is nominated for playing howard hughes in the aviator, will join other hopefuls such as co star cate blanchett, natalie portman and kate winslet as oscar presenters. the event at the kodak theatre will be attended by 3,300 people, including some of the best known names in film, and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. we have had rain up until the day before the show many times, but for some reason the oscar gods always shine on sunday and we hope they will do so again this year, he added. it is hoped the forecast for sunday, for cool weather but no rain, will prove accurate. the last time it rained on oscars night was in the mid to late 1980s, said oscars communications director john pavlik.
