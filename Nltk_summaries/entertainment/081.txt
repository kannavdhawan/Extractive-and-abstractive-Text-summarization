oscars race enters final furlong the race for the oscars entered its final stages as the deadline for voters to choose their winners passed. the event at the kodak theatre will be attended by 3 300 people including some of the best known names in film and organisers say they expect it will be watched on television by one billion people around the world. the 30 year old actor who is nominated for playing howard hughes in the aviator will join other hopefuls such as co star cate blanchett natalie portman and kate winslet as oscar presenters. the only people who will know the oscar winners before they are revealed at the ceremony will be the auditors who are in charge of looking after the ballot count. the last time it rained on oscars night was in the mid to late 1980s said oscars communications director john pavlik.
