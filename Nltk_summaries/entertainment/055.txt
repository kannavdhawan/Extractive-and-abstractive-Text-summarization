dvd review i robot only one man recognises that robots are a threat to humanity but that s fine because it only takes one man to save the day in the thriller i robot. less flashy than a david attenborough show and less detailed than a simon schama one the bbc series british isles nevertheless turned out to be quite engrossing. admit it the fact that this is one of the shows alan titchmarsh left ground force to present did mean that you expected something equally frothy. will smith co stars alongside more cgi robots than you can count and as a thrill a minute kind of action film it s perfectly adequate. there is a one disc version that has commentaries and a making of but the two disc adds more.
