berlin celebrates european cinema organisers say this year's berlin film festival, which opens on thursday with period epic man to man, will celebrate a revitalised european cinema. i'm not worried that we won't be able to fill the red carpet with stars, he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to january next year to avoid a similar clash. some 350 films will be screened at this year's festival, with a further 300 shown at the european film market that runs alongside it. more than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend, among them will smith, kevin spacey and keanu reeves. of the 21 films in competition for the golden and silver bear awards, more than half are from europe with france particularly well represented. this isn't to say there aren't any good american films, he continued.
