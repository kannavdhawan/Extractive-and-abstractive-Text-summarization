film production 'falls' 40% in uk the number of british films produced in the uk fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring johnny depp and jude law among those affected, screen daily has said. the uk film council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for british film production, when bridget jones the edge of reason, wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the uk. films with medium budgets of up to 9m, a similar level to box office hits vera drake, calendar girls and enduring love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. twenty seven british films were made in the uk last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. big budget co productions, such as the harry potter series, continued to be shot in the uk, however. it was too early to predict whether the downward trend in uk production would continue throughout 2005, the uk film council said.
