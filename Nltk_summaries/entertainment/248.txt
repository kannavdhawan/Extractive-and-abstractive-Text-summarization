but the artists beenie man, sizzla, elephant man, buju banton, bounty killer, tok, capleton and vybz kartel will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. the stop murder music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in sizzla's uk tour being cancelled in november, forced mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw beenie man dropped from an mtv show in august. the reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom, according to media and pr strategist glen yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry. the protests had been led by the stop murder music coalition, an umbrella group including outrage , the black gay men's advisory group and jamaican movement j flag. if you can't have major stars touring, then you don't sell many albums, he said.
