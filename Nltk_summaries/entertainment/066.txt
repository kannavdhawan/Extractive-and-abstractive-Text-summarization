us box office set for record high ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year with figures expected to reach 9.4 billion beating 2002 s all time high. according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as 6.25 in 2004 compared to 5.80 in 2002. this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 9 11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters. sony pictures responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years with 1 billion plus in sales for the third consecutive year. warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around 1.25 billion with disney at number three. overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last year s oscar winning lord of the rings.
