music piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the uk music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world wide cd sales. emma pike, director general of british music rights, said we believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. the education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. he said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from unscrupulous individuals. henri yoxall, general manager of british music rights, told bbc news schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. the lessons, aimed at 11 to 14 year olds, will introduce them to copyright including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of cds and its role in protecting creativity.
