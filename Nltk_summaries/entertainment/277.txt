the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi occupied austria in 1938. sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria, including yodelling, goat herds and lederhosen.
