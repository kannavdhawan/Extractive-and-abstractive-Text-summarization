moreno debut makes oscar mark catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language fil she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards instead recognising quirkier low budget film and at the 2004 berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize theron s oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied awar but she is taking her time committing to her next project hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenaba
