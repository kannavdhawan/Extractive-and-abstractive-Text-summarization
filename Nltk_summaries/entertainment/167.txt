a listers flock to gervais sitcom hollywood actors samuel l jackson and ben stiller have signed up for ricky gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told bbc news. gervais and his writing partner stephen merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six part series, in which gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. meanwhile, gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march, around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office. a film will happen over the next three years but i don't want it to be a 50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another spider man or batman. we wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of big brother to take part. he said stiller and jackson would be playing twisted versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them would sail pretty close to the bone .
