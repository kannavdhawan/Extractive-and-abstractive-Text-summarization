conti immediately told the show s director i start cursing and screaming i tell him we re not going to die for this show you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we re going to be home in 10 minutes. music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment. conti s most nerve wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in 1977 when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece. so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti.
