branson show flops on us screens entrepreneur sir richard branson's us tv show, the rebel billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings. the apprentice, which has already completed its first season, is still managing to pull in 16 million viewers, while its prime time ranking is number four. the rebel billionaire has marketed itself as a less materialistic version of the apprentice, with sir richard shown jumping out of a taxi, while trump is seen in a limousine. the show is seen as fox's answer to the apprentice featuring tycoon donald trump, a ratings hit for rivals nbc. contestants on sir richard's show are confronted with business tasks to solve, similar to the apprentice. it's going to remain on the air, said the network's spokesman scott grogin.
