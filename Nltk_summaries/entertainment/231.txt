three djs replace peel radio show the late john peel's bbc radio 1 show is to be succeeded in february by three shows hosted by three djs focusing on diverse, non commercial music. radio 1's controller, andy parfitt, said we believe that by having a series of djs hosting a selection of shows under the one music title, we will ensure that his legacy lives on. huw stephens is currently one half of the radio 1 thursday night show bethan and huw in wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts breaking through in wales. one music is not new to radio 1 as it already exists as a website, offering advice on aspects of the music industry, such as recording a demo and signing a record contract. it added that one music would support both signed and unsigned talent, and said it will seek out those making music for music's sake rather than for commercial success.
