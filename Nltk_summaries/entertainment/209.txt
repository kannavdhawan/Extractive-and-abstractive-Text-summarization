us show sued for rat eating stunt a us tv network is being sued for 2.5m 1.3m by a viewer who says he was disgusted by watching contestants eat dead rats in a stunt show. the hand written, four page lawsuit said to have the individuals on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and from a viewer's point of view made me throw up as well as another in the house at the same time.
