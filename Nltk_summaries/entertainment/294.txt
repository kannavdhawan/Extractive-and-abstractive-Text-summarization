i know there will be a lot of disappointed british tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in london, but we couldn't get a london theatre in time, added the british producer. the world premiere of the stage musical, co produced by canadian theatrical impresarios david and ed mirvish, will take place at toronto's princess of wales theatre next year. the music for the show is being written by bollywood composer ar rahman, who was behind andrew lloyd webber's west end musical bollywood dreams, and in conjuction with the finnish group varttina. the production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale, he said. the tolkien books and films are hugely popular in canada, said mr wallace, shortly after signing the deal in canada. auditions begin in canada on thursday, but up to five british actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with canadian actors' equity.
