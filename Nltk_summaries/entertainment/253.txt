. i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn't that good i'm happy for robbie himself though best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels.
