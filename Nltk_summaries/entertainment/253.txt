i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn t that good i m happy for robbie himself though best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not i didn t realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10 people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last 25 years not a chance. it s alright for a pop song but the best song of the last 25 years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it s a travesty. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years. the queen s song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why weren t the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him best song of the last 25 years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner.
