. i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn't that good i'm happy for robbie himself though best song in the last 25 years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels. why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10 people have such short memories a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years not a chance. why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom , should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.
