as a scot living in england, i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success, so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand, travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no. if they can fund football, why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music.
