if they can fund football why not fund music areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. as a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods i think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no. i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn t have to fork out a great deal. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol style music that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. franz man seeks government help franz ferdinand frontman alex kapranos has called for more government help for musicians while taking part in an edinburgh lectures discussion.
