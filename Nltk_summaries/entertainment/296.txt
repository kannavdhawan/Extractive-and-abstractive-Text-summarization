snow patrol bassist exits group snow patrol had no other course of action but to ask their co founder and bassist to leave the band, lead singer gary lightbody has said. last month, they were the big winners in ireland's top music honours, the meteor awards, picking up accolades for best band and album. in a statement on the band's website, lightbody said i started the group with mark 10 years ago and he was a massive part of snow patrol and my life throughout that decade. the group, originally from northern ireland, has only achieved mainstream success in the last year with the single run and award winning album final straw. lightbody said over the last 18 months touring has taken its toll on the rest of the band's relationship with him . mark mcclelland had been in the band for more than 10 years since its formation at dundee university.
