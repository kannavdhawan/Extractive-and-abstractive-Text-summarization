mull historical society, deacon blue, idlewild, texas, mogwai and teenage fanclub are among the other acts performing at the concert. all 10,000 tickets for saturday's concert, featuring franz ferdinand, belle and sebastian and travis, at glasgow's secc sold out in 36 hours. we all know somebody who was there, but more than that it was that we had never seen a wave of destruction, a natural disaster, like this in my generation. colin macintyre, of mull historical society, was playing another gig on the same day but said he was determined to make the glasgow benefit. it follows a cardiff gig starring eric clapton, keane and jools holland, which raised more than 1.25m.
