to help people in their browsing, evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful, often comic, aside. the elaborate nature of the pieces, many custom made, had to be admired, particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary liner. and, almost hidden at the back of the lock up, were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel 4 show, although these were not for sale. among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas, chairs, pictures, beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows. asked the reason for the sale, evans said i just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache. why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it, said mr hellewell.
