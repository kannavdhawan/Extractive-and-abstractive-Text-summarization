babyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the libertines, played a warm up show at the garage, north london, on monday. babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 gmt, launching into their last single, killamangiro, which reached number eight in december. doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. on tuesday, doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by mick jones, the former clash guitarist who produced the libertines' second album. the music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect walden's guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying there's a few people getting hurt down the front, you've got to move back.
