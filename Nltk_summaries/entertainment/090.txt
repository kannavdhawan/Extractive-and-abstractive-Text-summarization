berlin cheers for anti nazi film a german movie about an anti nazi resistance heroine has drawn loud applause at berlin film festival. scholl and other members of the white rose resistance group first started distributing anti nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942. they were arrested as they dropped leaflets at munich university calling for a day of reckoning with adolf hitler s regime. their discovery was the inspiration behind the film for rothemund who worked closely with surviving relatives including one of scholl s sisters to ensure historical accuracy on the film. the film focuses on the six days from scholl s arrest to the intense trial which saw scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance. a south african film version of bizet s tragic opera carmen shot in cape town in the xhosa language has also premiered at the berlin festival.
