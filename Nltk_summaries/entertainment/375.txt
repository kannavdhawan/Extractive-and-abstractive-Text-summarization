jackson's defence questioned ms kite's credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer's team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star. ms kite said she received a phone call on 13 february 2003 from a jackson associate, marc schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been staying. the defence protested after mr bashir, who interviewed jackson for the tv documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a california shield law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. in the prosecution's opening statement on monday, tom sneddon told the court that mr jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. ms kite told the court she had later asked jackson's lawyer, david legrand, what had happened.
