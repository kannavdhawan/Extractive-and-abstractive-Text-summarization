the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957. the pre masters include a take of jailhouse rock, religious songs, material for his first christmas album, and banter between presley, members of his band and engineer thorne nogar. we've had them for a lot of years, and i think the people should enjoy them, nogar's son stephen, 57, said. nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back up in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs. because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes can only be sold for personal enjoyment and they cannot be copied for commercial gain. he called them his ass saver tapes, his son said.
