compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, mtv's programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence and mtv's shows are aimed at children as young as 12. there's no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children. the ptc monitored mtv's output for 171 hours from 20 march to 27 march 2004, during the channel's spring break coverage.
