stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music and let s especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour. urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doesn t that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc. i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. brits debate over urban music joss stone a 17 year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards. who s ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson.. they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards.
