good luck to joss stone, let's celebrate her victory let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as jamelia, lemar, kanye west, dizzee rascal, alicia keys and outkast we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award. if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop, soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets, although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize, joss stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. brits debate over 'urban' music joss stone, a 17 year old soul singer from devon, beat dizzee rascal, jamelia, lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards. stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour. if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain, i think that's where you can call it urban that's where this new sub category, or uber category, has come from.
