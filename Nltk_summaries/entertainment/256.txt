good luck to joss stone, let's celebrate her victory let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as jamelia, lemar, kanye west, dizzee rascal, alicia keys and outkast we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award. if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop, soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets, although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize, joss stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year.
