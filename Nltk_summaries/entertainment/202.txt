parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over 2 billion a year, is used. our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money, said the committee chairman, mp edward leigh. the bbc launched freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky, to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news 24 to be seen. the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscription free access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in 2002. but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problem. bbc 'should allow more scrutiny' mps have urged the bbc to give watchdogs more freedom to scrutinise how 2bn in licence fee money is spent.
