my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavian... rainbow i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because it s original witty and modern. one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90. it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe s car. should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth back get your hands off the clangers is nothing sacred make a movie version of the banana splits what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy. roundabout continues nostalgia trip the new big screen version of the magic roundabout released in the uk on friday is the latest attempt to turn children s television into box office gold. it s all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it.
