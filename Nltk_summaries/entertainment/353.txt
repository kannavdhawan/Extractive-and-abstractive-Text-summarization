. rainbow i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone, and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office, especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern. you forgot to mention the grearest of them all, danger mouse but then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it it's always nice to see these old toons re released, but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think i've been completely put off. recent years have seen a less than successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit's five children and it, previously filmed by the bbc in 1991. he man and transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation this time computer created flat cell like animation failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate.
