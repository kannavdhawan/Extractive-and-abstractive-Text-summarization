icon spent very little on advertising the film, which deals with the last hours of jesus christ's life, when it was released earlier this year instead, it made the film available for special screenings at churches. academy president frank pierson praised gibson's move for working to restore the oscars as a celebration and appreciation of excellence, and resisting the crass commercialisation that was threatening the integrity of the award . this film should be judged on its artistic merit, not who spends more money on advertising, davey said. no ads for passion oscar campaign producer mel gibson will not be using paid advertisements to promote the passion of the christ to voters in next year's academy awards. gibson and his icon productions partner bruce davey said they would not be campaigning in print, radio or tv for success at the oscars in february.
