to mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley, rob partridge marley's former head of press at island records remembers the man behind the legend. bob, in worldwide terms, is the greatest music star there has ever been. if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere, in places john lennon or elvis wouldn't be. partridge worked with marley from 1977 until the jamaican musician's death in 1981. i joined island records in 1977 and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre. in 1991, ten years after his death, he sold more records than at any time during his life. i'm sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic.
