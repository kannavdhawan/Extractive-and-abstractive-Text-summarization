 my memories of marley... to mark the 60th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley rob partridge marley s former head of press at island records remembers the man behind the legend. partridge worked with marley from 1977 until the jamaican musician s death in 1981. i joined island records in 1977 and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre. i m sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic. we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time. but bob in the 1990s became one of the great icons in america and the third world.
