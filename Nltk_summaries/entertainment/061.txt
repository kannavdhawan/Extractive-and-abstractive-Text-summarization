first, when i was 16, it was becky sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because i recognised myself in her i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in, she said. she is not restricted to bollywood, however she followed salaam bombay with mississippi masala, starring denzel washington, and the perez family, her first hollywood film. it was a self fulfilling prophesy when i first met her husband actor ryan philippe , i said 'knock her up, won't you, i need some flesh on the girl', she joked. this was, for me, about becky sharp being, eventually, a full blown woman through the course of the film. as i got older and read it, i think it was thackeray's clarity his clear sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. she runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses she does everything, nair said.
