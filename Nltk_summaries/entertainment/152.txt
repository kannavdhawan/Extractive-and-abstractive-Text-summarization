the rca tapes date from september 1956 to september 1957. the pre masters include a take of jailhouse rock, religious songs, material for his first christmas album, and banter between presley, members of his band and mr nogar. and frankly, we could use the money, mr nogar's son stephen, 57, said before the auction. mr nogar, who died in 1994 aged 72, always used to make two tapes of sessions as a back up in case rca producers wanted to make late changes to songs. auction spokesman erik simon said the presley tapes were withdrawn because they did not meet the minimum price set by the owners . because the family does not own the copyright to the music, the tapes could only be sold for personal enjoyment and cannot be copied for commercial gain. he called them his 'ass saver' tapes, his son said.
