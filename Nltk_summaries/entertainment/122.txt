dance music not dead says fatboy dj norman cook aka fatboy slim has said that dance music is not dead but has admitted it is currently going through a fallow patch . the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain s two biggest dance acts fatboy slim s palookaville and the prodigy s always outnumbered never outgunned has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where it s happening in music. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track then .
