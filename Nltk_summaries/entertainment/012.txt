neeson in bid to revive theatre hollywood film star liam neeson has held a dinner party in new york to promote belfast s lyric theatre. the oscar nominated actor whose films include schindler s list michael collins and star wars the phantom menace said the lyric is too important to the cultural and social life of northern ireland for this building to crumble and fall apart. the lyric began 50 years ago but the doors opened at its present site on the stranmillis embankment overlooking the river lagan in 1968. as well as liam neeson it also launched the careers of adrian dunbar and stephen rea and playwrights such as martin lynch and gary mitchell. speaking to bbc northern ireland before the event at new york s soho house mr neeson said that his spirit belonged to the glens of antrim. mr neeson said that the idea was to get a bunch of healthy wealthy irish americans in one room and ask them to help with fundraising.
