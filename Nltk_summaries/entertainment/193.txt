prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because, for example, they wonder 'why wasn't everything tested ' well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested, dr houck explained. the csi effect is basically the perception of the near infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show, said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us. crime scene investigation csi and its spin offs, csi miami and csi new york, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic. evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim. csi shows give 'unrealistic view' people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows, real experts say. dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level there's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.
