british stars who appear on the current recording, such as dido and coldplay's chris martin, are well known to music fans across the atlantic, along with u2 frontman bono. record company universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across europe, asia, south america and canada. however, the new version of the 1984 single is not going to be released in the us, despite being sold in many countries around the world. in 1985, a group of high profile american stars known as usa for africa came together to record their own fund raising single, we are the world. the record is also tipped to become this year's christmas number one, as the original version did in 1984. proceeds from the sales are going towards relief for the darfur region of sudan and to combat hiv and aids across africa.
