redford s vision of sundance despite sporting a corduroy cap pulled low over his face plus a pair of dark glasses robert redford cuts an unmistakable figure through the star struck crowds at sundance. redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent film makers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream. people started to say we had gone mainstream and hollywood but actually hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film he adds. but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. smaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundance s limelight.
