fahrenheit 9 11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the palme d'or at the cannes international film festival in 2004. moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says tim dams, the news editor of trade magazine screen international. the problem with mel gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic, an ancient middle eastern language. they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious, he said. if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front runners would have had to be michael moore's bush baiting documentary fahrenheit 9 11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ. but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ a film accused of being anti semitic receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.
