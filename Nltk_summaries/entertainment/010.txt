the play promotes illegal, unnatural sexual acts, homosexuality and prostitution, it should be and is hereby banned, the council's ruling said. i'm extremely outraged at the hypocrisy, the play's organiser in uganda, sarah mukasa, told the bbc's focus on africa programme. uganda bans vagina monologues uganda's authorities have banned the play the vagina monologues, due to open in the capital, kampala this weekend. but the work's author, us playwright eve ensler, says it is all about women's empowerment. the show, which has been a controversial sell out around the world, explores female sexuality and strength through individual women telling their stories through monologues. i'm amazed that this country uganda gives the impression that it is progressive and supports women's rights and the notions of free speech yet when women want to share their stories the government uses the apparatus of state to shut us up.
