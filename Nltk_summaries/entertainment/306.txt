when the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel, said the festival's executive director, craig prater. irons, whose film being julia is in competition for the festival's golden kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after december's catastrophe. mr prater's sentiments were echoed by christine rush, director of the festival's sister event, the bangkok film market. but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher, alongside such screen stars as michael douglas, jeremy irons and jean claude van damme. our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund, he continued. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong, tokyo and pusan in south korea, mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal.
