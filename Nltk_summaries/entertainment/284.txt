dj double act revamp chart show dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio 1's flagship chart show on sunday, adding showbiz news, celebrity interviews and between song banter. radio 1's chart show is an institution and remains the station's single most popular show, says jk, also known as jason king. on the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes, says king, 30, who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcaster . the advantage joel and i have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive, king says. while sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april.
