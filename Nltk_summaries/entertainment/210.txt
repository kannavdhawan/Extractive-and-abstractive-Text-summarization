muslim group attacks tv drama 24 a british muslim group has criticised the new series of us drama 24 which is about to be aired on sky one claiming it portrays islam unfairly. the muslim council of britain said in a statement we are greatly concerned by the unremittingly hostile and unbalanced portrayal of muslims in this series of 24 based upon a preview of the first five episodes that we have seen. fox tv which shows the series in the us is broadcasting public service announcements showing muslims in a positive light after complaints about the series. at a time when negative stereotypes of muslims are on the increase we feel that sky as a major uk broadcaster has a responsibility to challenge these insidious views not help to reinforce them. the group s members met with sky executives on tuesday after viewing previews of the first five episodes.
