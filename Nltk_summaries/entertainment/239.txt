fightstar take to the stage charlie simpson took his new band fightstar to the stage on friday night just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band busted. while simpson declared he would look back with pride on busted s enormous success his focus turned immediately to fightstar with friday s press conference coinciding with the start of the band s 13 date tour of the uk. less impressed were fellow students ryan crabbe and gordon rennie who observed with fightstar charlie has clearly progressed from busted s sound but they re still not very inspiring. confirmation of busted s long rumoured split had come earlier in the day when simpson held a press conference in london with bandmates matt willis and james bourne. although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any busted concert.
