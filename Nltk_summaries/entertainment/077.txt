dvd review spider man 2 it s a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. sometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man. this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilma s erin gray tongue in cheek adventures and it s all as camp and gaudy as you remember. it s not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne s earlier films there s no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extras.
