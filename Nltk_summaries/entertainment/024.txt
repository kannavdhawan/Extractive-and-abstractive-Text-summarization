one fiction judge, stewart o'nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said i would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy. this year's fiction panel overlooked high profile works such as philip roth's the plot against america and instead chose five little known books, all by new york based women. the national book awards non fiction prize was awarded to kevin boyle's for arc of justice, which focuses on a black family's fight to live in a white detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. sales of blume's books have exceeded 75 million, but her work which features frank narratives about families, religion and sexuality is closely watched by the censors. last year's honorary winner, stephen king, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. children's author judy blume, who was given an honourary medal, used the ceremony to speak out over censorship.
