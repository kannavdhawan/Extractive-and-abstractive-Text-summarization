john peel replacement show begins the permanent replacement for late dj john peel's bbc radio 1 show goes on air on tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot. huw stephens has been one half of the thursday night show bethan and huw in wales, which explores new music, especially up and coming acts in wales. rock dj huw stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every tuesday, with black music champion ras kwame on wednesdays and dance dj rob da bank on thursdays. radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace peel, but would rise to the challenge of keeping his legacy alive with unpredictable music. this time next year i hope we are saying how well these djs have done, but i fear this time next year we will really realise how much john peel will be forever missed. bbc radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.
