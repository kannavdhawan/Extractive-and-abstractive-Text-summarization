gold falls on imf sale concerns the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund imf said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief. the us, which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. by revaluing its holdings, the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. the imf values its gold reserves at between 40 and 50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value. whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings, said john reade, an analyst at ubs. while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward.
