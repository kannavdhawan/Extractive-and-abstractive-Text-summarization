gold falls on imf sale concerns the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund imf said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief. while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. by revaluing its holdings the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world s poorest nations. the imf values its gold reserves at between 40 and 50 an ounce a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal s current market value. imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.
