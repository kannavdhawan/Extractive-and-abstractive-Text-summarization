gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world s largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer african countries back into europe for resale at far higher pric the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government s health care system the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trad but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher pric
