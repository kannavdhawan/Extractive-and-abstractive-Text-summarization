gsk aims to stop aids profiteers one of the world's largest manufacturers of hiv aids drugs has launched an initiative to combat the smuggling of cheaper pills supplied to poorer african countries back into europe for resale at far higher price. the result is that drugs supplied to africa are now more than thirty times cheaper than those sold in europe bringing these medicines within the reach of millions of hiv positive africans through their government's health care systems. the company says that it will then be possible to identify specific distributors in africa who have re sold humanitarian drugs for profit, as well as those suppliers in europe that have also been involved in the trade. the company, glaxosmithkline, is to alter the packaging and change the colour of the pills, currently provided to developing nations under a humanitarian agreement. but the wide difference in price also means that there are big gains to be made from illegally diverting these cheaper drugs back into wealthier countries and re selling them at a higher price. glaxosmithkline believes that by coating the pills destined for africa in a red dye and adding new identification codes both onto the pills and on the packaging, then this trade can be substantially reduced.
