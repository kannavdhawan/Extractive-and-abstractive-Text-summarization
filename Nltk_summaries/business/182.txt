the french statistics agency, insee, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. the unemployment figures show the main problem of the french economy we have growth but without an improvement in employment, said marc touati, an economist at natexis banques populaires. analysts said french companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. oil prices will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence, he said. politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late. official figures showed on friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in october.
