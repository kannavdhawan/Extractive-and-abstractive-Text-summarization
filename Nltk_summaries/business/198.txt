cairn shares up on new oil find shares in cairn energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an indian oilfield was larger than previously thought. cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in december following a disappointing drilling update. before christmas, cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day. the firm has applied for a 30 month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the mangala and aishwariya fields where cairn has previously announced major discoveries. cairn's shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on thursday. however, on thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct.
