the rising cost of maintaining such schemes has led many employers to replace final salary schemes with money purchase, or defined contribution, schemes. a final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire. helen sudell, editor of the ids pensions service, said the rise in contributions was staggering and the highest ever recorded by ids. a survey of 280 schemes by incomes data services' ids said employer contributions had increased from 5.5bn to 8.2bn a year, a rise of 49.7%. in 1998 99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002 03 by 8.6%. we have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision, said ms sudell.
