i think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time, said robert sinche, head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york. the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the us's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. the half point window, some believe, could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. on friday, federal reserve chairman mr greenspan's speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse than expected us jobs data. china's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive.
