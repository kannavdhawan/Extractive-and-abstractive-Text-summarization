mr vaile, who was quoted in the australian financial review, compared xstrata's attempt to take over wmc to a similar bid by oil giant shell for australia's woodside petroleum in 2001. the bid was thrown out by treasurer peter costello on national interest grounds. wmc itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target as long as the price is right. wmc profits up amid bid criticism australian mining firm wmc resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid. wmc said it made net profits of 1.33bn australian dollars 1bn 550m in 2004, up from a 246bn the year before. wmc's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, mr vaile said.
