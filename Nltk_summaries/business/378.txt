turkmen president saparmurat niyazov, who signed the contract, said the turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by 2 per 1,000 cubic metres, bringing it down to 58. but the new price is still 14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. the head of the ukrainian state owned naftohaz company, yury boyko, said he was fully happy with the deal. analysts say thay may not happen as russia, the world's leading gas producer, needs the cheap turkmen gas only to relieve is state owned gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in siberia. supplies from turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. ukraine strikes turkmen gas deal ukraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by turkmenistan. on friday, turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head.
