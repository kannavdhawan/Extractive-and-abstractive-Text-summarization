the agreement in question dates back to gm's decision to buy 20% of fiat's auto division in 2000. at the time, it gave the italian firm the right, via a 'put option', to sell the remaining stake to gm. however, gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year, which cut gm's holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement.
