the agreement in question dates back to gm's decision to buy 20% of fiat's auto division in 2000. at the time, it gave the italian firm the right, via a 'put option', to sell the remaining stake to gm. however, gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year, which cut gm's holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement. fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own gm says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid. as far as we are aware, the agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. gm in crunch talks on fiat future fiat will meet car giant general motors gm on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm's loss making auto group.
