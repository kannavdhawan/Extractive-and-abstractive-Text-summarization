the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh, cambodia, sri lanka and nepal, andrew pendleton, christian aid's head of trade policy, said. millions 'to lose textile jobs' millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned. while the current mfa was not perfect, its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, christian aid said. some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade.
