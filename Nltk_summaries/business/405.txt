martin ellis, halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank's prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005. sound housing market fundamentals will continue to underpin the market in 2005, ensuring that the market remains healthy and that house prices fall only slightly, mr ellis said. the biggest decline was seen in wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004. overall, halifax said prices in the final quarter of 2004 were 0.1% higher than in the previous quarter.
