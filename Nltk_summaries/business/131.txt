speaking on ntv television which is controlled by gazprom mr miller added that yugansk which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year will operate as a separate state owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead but will not include yugansk which was controversially bought last year. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8 of russia s total oil production an improvement on its current 2.5 but still far less than the 20 share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk. obtaining majority control over gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in gazprom shares mr miller added. gazprom chief alexei miller confirmed rosneft owned yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.
