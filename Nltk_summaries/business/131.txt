speaking on ntv television, which is controlled by gazprom, mr miller added that yugansk, which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8% of russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk. russian oil merger excludes yukos the merger of russian gas giant gazprom and oil firm rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include yugansk, which was controversially bought last year. however, the merged group will still remain outside russia's top five oil producers led by lukoil with 11% of the market , followed by tnk bp which is half owned by bp, and surgutneftegaz. the merger, backed by russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in gazprom shares. ultimately and industrially, gazprom needs yugansk, he added.
