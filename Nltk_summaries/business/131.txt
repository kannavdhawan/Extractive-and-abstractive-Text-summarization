speaking on ntv television, which is controlled by gazprom, mr miller added that yugansk, which was swallowed up by rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state owned oil firm headed by current rosneft chief sergei bogdanchikov. analysts said the deal would give gazprom control of 8% of russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over yugansk.
