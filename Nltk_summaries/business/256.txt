singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004 singapore's economy grew by 8.1% in 2004, its best performance since 2000, figures from the trade ministry show. the advance, the second fastest in asia after china, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector. however, a slower than expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back. that was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts. in the fourth quarter, the city state's gross domestic product gdp rose at an annual rate of 2.4%. the economy's poor performance in the july to september period followed four consecutive quarters of double digit growth as singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly sars virus in 2003.
