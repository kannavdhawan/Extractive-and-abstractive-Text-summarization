this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three turks, would employ just one in five by 2020. such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned. and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts. in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product, says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable, says michael deppler, director of the imf's european department.
