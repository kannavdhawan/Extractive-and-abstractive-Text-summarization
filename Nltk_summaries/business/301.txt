libya takes 1bn in unfrozen funds libya has withdrawn 1bn in assets from the us, assets which had previously been frozen for almost 20 years, the libyan central bank has said. the us ban on trade and economic activity with tripoli imposed by then president ronald regan in 1986 after a series of what the us deemed terrorist acts, including the 1988 lockerbie air crash was suspended in april. we are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the united states, the central bank's vice president farhat omar ben gadaravice said. however, the withdrawal did not mean that libya had cut its ties with the us, he added. the original size of libya's funds was 400m, the central bank told reuters. the move came after the us lifted a trade ban to reward tripoli for giving up weapons of mass destruction and vowing to compensate lockerbie victims.
