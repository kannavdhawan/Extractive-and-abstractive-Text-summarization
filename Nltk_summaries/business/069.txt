it is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777 200lr and its much anticipated 787 dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. the 777 200lr, which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us, is the fifth variation of boeing's twin aisle 777 plane. boeing unveils new 777 aircraft us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer. boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful, said david learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international. boeing, in contrast to european rival airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract. but the 777 200lr is a niche player , mr learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft.
