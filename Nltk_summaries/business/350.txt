dollar hits new low versus euro the us dollar has continued its record breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro. investors are betting that the european central bank ecb will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the us is thought to favour a declining dollar. it's not going to take much to push the dollar one way or the other, said grant wilson of mellon bank. the us is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar. this compares with 1.354 to the euro in late trading in new york on friday, which was then a record low.
