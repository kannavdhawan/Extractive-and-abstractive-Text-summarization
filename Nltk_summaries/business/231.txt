if we don't do this, we are just going to carry on being slaves, suppliers of raw materials, all our lives and we will never develop our own productive capacity, mr alvarez added. for this reason we are reviewing all memorandums of understanding, all letters of intent, all agreements that have been signed, all contracts, to check which of these comply with these directives. announcing the review of raw material production, minister victor alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology, training capability and content from projects with foreign partners. companies from the united states, canada, france and switzerland all have substantial investments in venezuela's mining sector. however, the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners.
