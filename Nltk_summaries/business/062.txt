wembley firm won't make a profit shares in multiplex group, which is building the new wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project. investors were shaken by the news and the firm's shares fell to a four month low of a 4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at a 4.67. the decline came despite multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre tax profits to a 67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. to recoup any profit from wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. such a big writeback on the wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility, simon wheatley, from goldman sachs, told reuters. the australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn australian dollars 458m 874m rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work.
