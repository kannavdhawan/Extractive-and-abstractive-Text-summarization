yukos loses us bankruptcy battle a judge has dismissed an attempt by russian oil giant yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the us. yukos had argued that a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold, since it has local bank accounts and its chief finance officer bruce misamore lives in houston. the us court's jurisdiction had been challenged by deutsche bank and gazpromneft, a former unit of russian gas monopoly gazprom which is due to merge with rosneft. yukos claimed it sought help in the us because other forums russian courts and the european court of human rights were either unfriendly or offered less protection. the vast majority of the business and financial activities of yukos continue to occur in russia, judge clark said in her ruling. the court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of yugansk, which yukos claims was illegally sold.
