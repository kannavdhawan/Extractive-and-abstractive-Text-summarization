uk firm faces venezuelan land row venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez s agrarian reform programme. last month the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40 000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had nothing to fear . officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co operate fully with the authorities. critics say the powers which president chavez argues are needed to help the country s poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy trample all over private property rights.
