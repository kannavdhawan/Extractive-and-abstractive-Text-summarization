putin backs state grab for yukos russia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles. the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston, texas, where yukos, had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, a move that will see gazprom return to majority state ownership. by selling the yukos unit to little known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. you cannot sue the russian government, said eric kraus, a strategist at moscow's sovlink securities. gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction.
