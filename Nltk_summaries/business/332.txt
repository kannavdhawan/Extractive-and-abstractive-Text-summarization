putin backs state grab for yukos russia s president has defended the purchase of yukos key production unit by state owned oil firm rosneft saying it followed free market principles. by selling the yukos unit to little known baikal and then to rosneft russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines analysts said. lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos with an office in houston had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction. analysts say that yukos s legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week s cloak and dagger dealings. the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday s auction.
