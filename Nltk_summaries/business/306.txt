retail sales show festive fervour uk retail sales were better than expected in november as christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the high street, figures show. however, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind november's unexpected rise in sales, they say. however, recent data from the british retail consortium showed a 0.2% slip in high street sales during november. price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn't grown as much as volumes, said investec economist david page. but the figures, along with this week's inflation report, could trigger another interest rate rise in the new year. aggressive tactics, such as one day discount sales adopted by stores such as marks spencer, appear to have paid off.
