cairn shares slump on oil setback shares in cairn energy, a uk oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands. the company said the rate would be about 900 rupees 20.40 10.50 per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. cairn, which also operates in nepal and bangladesh, was catapulted into the ftse 100 index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which cairn argues it is not liable. i think people were slightly over ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves, said analyst jason kenney at ing. the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas.
