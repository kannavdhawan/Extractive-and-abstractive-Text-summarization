central to the government's case was a meeting in the plaza hotel, new york, on 15 december, 1953. prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. it's pretty clear that they've suffered a severe setback, said anthony sebok, a professor at brooklyn law school, adding that the appeal was what the government would be expected to ask for . among the firms accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. altria's philip morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer william ohlemeyer told the bbc last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest.
