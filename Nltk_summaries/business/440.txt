although china s overall trade surplus is expanding according to chinese government figures the commerce department revealed the us s deficit with china was 19.6bn in november down from 19.7bn the month before. us trade deficit widens sharply the gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than 60bn 31.7bn an all time record. the main catalyst most economists accept is the large budget deficit on the one hand and the current account deficit the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us on the other. one small bright spot for us policy makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. although the white house officially still backs the us s traditional strong dollar policy it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued.
