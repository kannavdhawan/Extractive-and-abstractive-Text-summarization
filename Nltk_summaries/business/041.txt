fed chief warning on us deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has warned that allowing huge us budget deficits to continue could have severe consequences. he called on congress to cut promised benefits for retirees as the promised benefits for the soon to retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford. he also urged congress to reinstate lapsed rules that require tax cuts and spending to be offset elsewhere in the budget in an effort to prevent the us heading further into the red. while the us economy is growing at a reasonably good pace he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the us. meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending he added.
