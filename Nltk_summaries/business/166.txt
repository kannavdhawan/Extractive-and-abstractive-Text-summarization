crossrail link 'to get go ahead' the 10bn crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go ahead this month, according to the mail on sunday. the new line would go out as far as maidenhead, berkshire, to the west of london, and link heathrow to canary wharf via the city. jeremy de souza, a spokesman for crossrail, said on sunday he could not confirm whether the treasury was planning to invest 7.5bn or when the bill would go before parliament. the line has the support of the mayor of london, ken livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. heathrow to the city would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. we've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid bill for crossrail in the spring and this remains the case, the department for transport said on sunday.
