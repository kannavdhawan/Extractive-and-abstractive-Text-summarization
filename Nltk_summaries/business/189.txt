ferrari, in which fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007. mr marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said fiat auto was now the principal focus of his attention. the car business, best known for its alfa romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. sales are expected to fall in 2005, fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. last year, he said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group's recovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. mr demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in november 2003 after being recruited by former fiat chief executive giuseppe morchio. the car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break even target from 2005 to 2006. the management changes are part of a wider shake up of the business following fiat's resolution of its dispute with general motors.
