saab to build cadillacs in sweden general motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium sized cadillac bls at its loss making saab factory in sweden. beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations, gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs, opels badged as vauxhalls in the uk and now cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market.
