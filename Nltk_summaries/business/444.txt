previously considered to be russia's richest man, with an estimated fortune of 15bn, mr khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in october 2003. however, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by russian president vladimir putin to rein in the country's super rich business leaders, the so called oligarchs. mr khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of yukos' core oil production unit, yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.
