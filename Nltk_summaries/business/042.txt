uk coal operates 15 deep and surface mines across nottinghamshire, derbyshire, leicestershire, yorkshire, the west midlands, northumberland and durham. the south yorkshire company, led by new chief executive gerry spindler, said it hoped to return to profit in 2006. in early trade on thursday, its shares were down 10% at 119 pence. total production costs were 1.30 per gigajoule, uk coal said, but the average selling price was just 1.18 per gigajoule. it expected 2005 to be a transitional year and to return to profitability in 2006. the recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. the uk's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and operating flaws at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes.
