iran budget seeks state sell offs iran's president, mohammad khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the islamic republic's dependence on oil. it came not long after the expediency council iran's ultimate decision maker blessed mr khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. in contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to 14.1bn from 16bn in the year to march 2005. current government expenditure should come from tax revenues, mr khatami said. continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of mr khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues. in an address to the majlis, mr khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005 6, up from 6.7% in the current year.
