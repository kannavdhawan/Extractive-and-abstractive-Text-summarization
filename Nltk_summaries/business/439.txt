german economy rebounds germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports. concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. during 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong, said stefan schilbe, analyst at hsbc trinkaus burkhardt. if exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005. many german consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. the economy contracted in 2003. foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption.
