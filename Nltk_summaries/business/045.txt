us crude prices surge above 53 us crude prices have soared to fresh four month highs above 53 in the us as refinery problems propelled petrol prices to an all time high. ed silliere, analyst at energy merchant, added gasoline is up because of the refinery issues in texas, which means there will be a scramble for product in the us gulf coast. elsewhere, a refinery in houston was closed due to mechanical problems, while on tuesday production at bp's texas city refinery was taken down for a short time. oil prices are roughly 45% higher than a year ago and have risen sharply in recent weeks due to a combination of colder weather, the declining value of the dollar and fears that opec could rein in production to head off a seasonal drop in demand. meanwhile, oil production cartel opec's recent announcement that it was now unlikely to cut production levels has also failed to calm fears on the market. in the approach to spring, the market becomes much more sensitive to problems with petrol production as dealers anticipate rising demand for fuel ahead of the holiday season.
