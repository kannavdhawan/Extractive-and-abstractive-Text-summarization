a number of large mci shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. according the legal papers filed in a delaware court, verizon is set to pay an unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate sum for mci, which was formerly known as worldcom. mci shareholder sues to stop bid a shareholder in us phone firm mci has taken legal action to halt a 6.75bn 3.6bn buyout by telecoms giant verizon, hoping to get a better deal. the lawsuit was filed on friday after qwest communications, which had an earlier offer for mci rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. friday's lawsuit argues that the verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the us phone industry will put a premium on mci's network, assets and clients. mci's directors have argued that verizon is bigger than qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division.
