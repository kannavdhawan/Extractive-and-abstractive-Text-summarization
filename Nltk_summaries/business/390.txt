wal mart to pay 14m in gun suit the world's largest retailer, wal mart, has agreed to pay a total of 14.5m 7.74m to settle a lawsuit over gun sales violations in california. wal mart agreed to suspend firearms sales in its california stores in 2003, the alleged violations included the sale of guns to 23 people who were not allowed to possess them, and delivering 36 guns to customers who acquired them for people not allowed to own firearms. the lawsuit alleged wal mart committed thousands of gun sales violations in california between 2000 and 2003. the total payment includes 5m in fines and more than 4m to fund state compliance checks with gun laws and prevent ammunition sales to minors. although wal mart has suspended gun sales in california, this settlement will ensure that it follows state law if it renews sales and will also provide valuable public education about the importance of gun safety. although wal mart has suspended firearms sales in the state, california attorney general bill lockyer said he wanted to be sure the giant supermarket chain would follow state rules in future. wal mart's failure to comply with gun safety laws put the lives of all californians at risk by placing guns in the hands of criminals and other prohibited persons, said mr lockyer.
