bank voted 8 1 for no rate change the decision to keep interest rates on hold at 4.75% earlier this month was passed 8 1 by the bank of england's rate setting body, minutes have shown. however, he added, any rate increase is not likely to happen until later this year, with mpc members likely to look for a more sustainable pick up in consumer spending before acting. the bank's latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending. worries over growth rates and consumer spending were behind the decision to freeze rates, the minutes showed. however, mpc member paul tucker voted for a quarter point rise in interest rates to 5%. ross walker, uk economist at royal bank of scotland, said he was surprised that a dissenting vote had been made so soon.
