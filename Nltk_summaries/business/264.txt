french suitor holds lse meeting european stock market euronext has met with the london stock exchange lse amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid. deutsche boerse previously offered 1.3bn, which was rejected by the lse, while euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a 1.4bn cash bid. commentators believe deutsche boerse, which has now formally asked german authorities to approve its plan to buy the lse, may offer to sell clearstream to gain shareholder approval. euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the lse europe's biggest equity market into a deal. meanwhile, lse shareholders fear that deutsche boerse's control over its clearstream unit the clearing house that processes securities transactions would create a monopoly situation. there was speculation euronext would use friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over deutsche boerse's own plans for dominance over the london market.
