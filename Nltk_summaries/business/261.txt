although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard hit, do indeed recover, the authors concluded. a series of recent shocks, the colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. a study of the 1993 des moines floods, from the disaster research center at the university of delaware , found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. and where insurance certainly is in place in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected the costs will be borne in far away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided.
