yukos bankruptcy 'not us matter' russian authorities do not have to abide by any us court decisions taken with regard to troubled oil giant yukos, a houston court has been told. deutsche bank maintains the case has no place in a us court because yukos has no assets in the us, apart from two bank accounts and a house in houston owned by its chief finance officer bruce misamore. us bankruptcy judge letitia clark, who issued an injunction in december to try and prevent the yugansk sale, has said she will rule pretty promptly, however i do not anticipate ruling on it before next tuesday . yukos says a us court was entitled to declare it bankrupt before its yugansk unit was sold, since it has a us subsidiary and local bank accounts. yukos made its surprise chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in houston in december in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of yugansk, its main oil producing unit, by russian authorities. it has claimed that russia imposed the huge tax bill and forced the sale of yugansk as part of a campaign to destroy yukos and its former owner mihkail khodorkovsky, who is facing a 10 year prison term in russia for fraud and tax evasion.
