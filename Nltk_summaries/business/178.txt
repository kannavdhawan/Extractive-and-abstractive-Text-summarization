russia wto talks 'make progress' talks on russia's proposed membership of the world trade organisation wto have been making good progress say those behind the negotiations. russia has been waiting for a decade to join the wto and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006. a decision could be reached in december, when the wto's 148 current members gather for a summit in hong kong. sticking points to membership have included limits on foreign ownership in the telecommunications and life insurance businesses, as well as issues surrounding counterfeiting, piracy, and data protection. some wto members also dislike russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give russian businesses an unfair advantage. while pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with russia, the us said the meeting was much more efficient than we've seen for some time .
