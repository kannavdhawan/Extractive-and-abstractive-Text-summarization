indonesia's previous government, led by president megawati sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests. the big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it, she said. indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. since president yudhoyono's government came to power in october, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. the january to march quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices, said sri mulyani indrawati, state minister for national development planning.
