a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole, cml director general michael coogan said. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year on year to 85,000 the lowest total seen since february 2003. data from the cml showed lending fell to just over 25bn in november, from 25.5bn a year earlier.
