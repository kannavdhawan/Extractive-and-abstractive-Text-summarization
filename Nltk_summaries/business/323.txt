a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole, cml director general michael coogan said. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year on year to 85,000 the lowest total seen since february 2003. data from the cml showed lending fell to just over 25bn in november, from 25.5bn a year earlier. it's a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market, investec economist philip shaw said. however, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely. miles shipside, commercial director at rightmove, said sellers would have to be more realistic with their asking prices to tempt buyers. the council of mortgage lenders cml , british bankers association bba and building societies association bsa all said mortgage lending was slowing.
