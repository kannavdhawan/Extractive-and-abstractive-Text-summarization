us gives foreign firms extra time foreign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the us stock market watchdog. they say the burden is too expensive and the timescale too short and some particularly the uk s cbi warned that companies would choose to let their us listings drop rather than get in line with section 404. the latest delegation from the cbi met sec officials on wednesday just before the decision to relax the deadline was announced. big us firms already have to meet the requirements but smaller ones and foreign based firms which list their shares on us stock markets originally had until the middle of this year. the securities and exchange commission has extended the deadline to get in line with the rules until 15 july 2006. many foreign firms had protested that the sec was imposing an unfair burden. the sec said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries.
