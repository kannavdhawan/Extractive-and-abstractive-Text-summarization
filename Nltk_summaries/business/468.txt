the matter of possible state aid was brought to the commission's attention by eight of alitalia's rivals, including germany's lufthansa, british airways and spain's iberia. eu to probe alitalia 'state aid' the european commission has officially launched an in depth investigation into whether italian airline alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. eu rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the one time, last time rule for airlines. otherwise, eu regulations on state aid stipulate that governments may help companies financially, but only on the same terms as a commercial investor. alitalia lost 330m euros in 2003 as it struggled to get to grips with high costs, spiralling oil prices, competition from budget carriers and reduced demand. while alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition.
