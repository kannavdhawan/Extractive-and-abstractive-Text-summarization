eu to probe alitalia state aid the european commission has officially launched an in depth investigation into whether italian airline alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. eu rules prevent that from happening again in what is known as the one time last time rule for airlines. the matter of possible state aid was brought to the commission s attention by eight of alitalia s rivals including germany s lufthansa british airways and spain s iberia. while alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. both the italian government and alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money part of a vital restructuring plan is state aid.
