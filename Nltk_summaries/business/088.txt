robert benmosche, metlife's chairman and chief executive, said that it was a great opportunity for the brand of metlife to be distributed through citigroup . metlife buys up citigroup insurer us banking giant citigroup has sold its travelers life annuity insurance arm to metlife for 11.5bn 6.1bn . this deal employs some of metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher return business and gives it more distribution, said stuart quint, an analyst at gartmore. for metlife, the us's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network. the sale is a further move by citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service insurance, broking and banking. under the agreement, metlife will be able to sell its products through citigroup over the next 10 years.
