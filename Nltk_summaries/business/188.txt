qwest may spark mci bidding war us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war. we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci, the letter from qwest said. also, mci, while trading under the name worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci. there may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april.
