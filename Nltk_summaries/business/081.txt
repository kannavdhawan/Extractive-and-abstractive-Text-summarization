bmw to recall faulty diesel cars bmw is to recall all cars equipped with a faulty diesel fuel injection pump supplied by parts maker robert bosch. the additional three day stoppage will mean a production loss of up to 3,600 vehicles, bmw said, adding that it was confident it could make up the numbers later. when asked if bmw would be seeking compensation from bosch, the carmaker's chief executive helmut panke said we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay . a spokesman for daimlerchrysler, parent company of mercedes benz, said it will however have to halt some production. audi said it had been hit by production bottlenecks, due to a shortage of unaffected bosch parts.
