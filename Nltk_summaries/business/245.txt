law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean up, economic development, the small business administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. interest sensitive industries will feel pain immediately sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output. second should be a dispassionate re evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to afghanistan, iraq, or terrorism. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts. reducing domestic spending, or eliminating waste, fraud and abuse is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.
