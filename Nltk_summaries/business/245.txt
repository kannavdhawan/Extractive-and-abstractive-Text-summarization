the ticking budget facing the us the budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial. news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill serve the nation s elderly and indigent. one thing is certain destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue simplify the tax code and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts.
