nevertheless, one of mr bakrie's deputies, mahendra siregar, told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. indonesia 'declines debt freeze' indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors, economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said. indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the paris club about 48bn 25.5bn . indonesia, sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. thailand and india have however declined the offer, with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid.
