but the london exchange is also holding talks with deutsche boerse's rival euronext, which operates the amsterdam, brussels, lisbon and paris exchanges, as well as london based international derivatives market liffe. the onus is on deutsche boerse's management to demonstrate why the purchase of the lse creates more value for shareholders than other strategies, such as a buyback, said richard moffat, investment director of uk equities at standard life investments. in december, deutsche boerse, which also owns the derivatives market eurex and the clearing firm clearstream, put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table. atticus capital, holding 2% of deutsche boerse, wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the lse. standard life concern at lse bid standard life is the latest shareholder in deutsche boerse to express concern at the german stock market operator's plans to buy the london stock exchange. reports say standard life, which owns a 1% stake in deutsche boerse, may seek a shareholder vote on the issue.
