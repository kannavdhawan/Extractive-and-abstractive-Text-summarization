sec to rethink post enron rules the us stock market watchdog s chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms. the act also applies to firms with more than 300 us shareholders a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in. the act comes into force in mid 2005. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations which critics say will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms the securities and exchange commission sec would continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements . mr donaldson said the sec would consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements.
