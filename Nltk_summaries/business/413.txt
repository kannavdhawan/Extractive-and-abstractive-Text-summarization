the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year, while france's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%.
