the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year, while france's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%. the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice which ruled eu countries could not put the pact in abeyance , and confirmed the ec's right to launch excessive debt procedures . despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies, it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. the scary fact is that budget sinners, despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit, do not have to fear any sanctions. ec calls truce in deficit battle the european commission ec has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.
