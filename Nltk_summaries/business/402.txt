us interest rate rise expected us interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since june following the us federal reserve s latest rate setting meeting later on tuesday. the fed has said that it will move in a measured way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40 year lows that were prompted by sluggish us and global growth. although the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9 in the three months to september analysts warn that fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery s sails. but if economic growth picked up and caused core inflation to rise a little more quickly i think the fed would be prepared to tighten more quickly as well. with the economic picture now looking more rosy the fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in june august september and november.
