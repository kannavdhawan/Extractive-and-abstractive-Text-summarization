on monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all time high against the dollar at above 1.30. oil pushed higher too on monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the us and europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. it seems persuasive that, given the size of the us current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point, he said. at present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. in london, the benchmark brent crude price closed down 51 cents at 44.38 a barrel, while new york light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at 48.64 a barrel. in the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with congress authorising an 800bn rise in what the us can owe taking the total to 8.2 trillion.
