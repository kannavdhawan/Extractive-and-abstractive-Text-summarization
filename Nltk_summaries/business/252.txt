central to the proposals are plans by bt to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly regulated access to bt's local network, the former monopoly said in a statement. this is a reminder to ofcom that as long as bt can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the uk's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile, a spokesman said. bt has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far reaching proposals towards that framework, he said. bt offers equal access to rivals bt has moved to pre empt a possible break up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals. to meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, bt said it would begin trials in april with a view to launching higher speed services nationally from the autumn. the group is to set up a new access services division with a separate board which would include independent members to ensure equal access for rivals to the local loop , the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households.
