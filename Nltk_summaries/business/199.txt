mr saakashvili, elected president in january after mr shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the georgian parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. the country's new president, mikhail saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. it is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the shevardnadze era, and boost georgia's fragile public finances. by declaring their assets and paying the one off tax, people would be able to legalise their property , mr saakashvili stressed. mr saakashvili has accused the shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in november, of allowing bribery to flourish. the new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 january, three days before president saakashvili was elected.
