standard life cuts policy bonuses standard life, europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with profit policyholders. it is the sixth time in three years standard life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with profits fund in 2004. the insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates. annual bonus rates on its with profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. john gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002 . standard life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. the insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. in addition, low interest rates meant that long term investment returns are well below historic levels , mr gill added.
