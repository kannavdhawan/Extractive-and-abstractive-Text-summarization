tsunami slows sri lanka s growth sri lanka s president has launched a reconstruction drive worth 3.5bn 1.8bn by appealing for peace and national unity. meanwhile the international monetary fund imf said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka s economic growth this year. foreign exchange reserves may become strained as sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre tsunami level which totalled more than two months worth of imports. separately the international labour organisation ilo said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone. the imf said that the sri lankan authorities initial estimates have put the physical damage at 1.3 to 1.5bn but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this.
