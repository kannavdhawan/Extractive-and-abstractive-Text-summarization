we have warned the russian government about their continuing attacks against yukos, its personnel and its shareholders and we have warned any buyer of yuganskneftegaz that they would face a lifetime of litigation, said tim osborne, a director of group menatep. according to its paris lawyer, emmanuel gaillard of shearman and sterling, the overall claim is based on that figure, with a 60% addition for the share gains that could have accrued since then. the kremlin last year seized and sold yukos' main production arm, yugansk, to state run oil group rosneft for 9.3bn to offset a massive back tax bill. according to menatep, the government's actions were contrary to the 1994 energy charter treaty, which was designed to regulate disagreements over energy investments. group menatep, the gibraltar based holding company which controls 51% of yukos, says this was illegal.
