lloyd's of london head chides fsa the head of lloyd's of london, the insurance market, has criticised britain's financial watchdog, the financial services authority fsa . brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the fsa said. the world's biggest insurance broker marsh mclennan said last week it would pay 850m to settle charges, raised by new york attorney general eliot spitzer in october, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. the probe centred around so called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers' customers. the fsa should change, and change now said mr prettejohn, who wants it to move from disclosure on request to mandatory disclosure.
