ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power. mr gates' company, software giant microsoft, also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux, which threaten microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops. the organisers of the brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes shimon peres.
