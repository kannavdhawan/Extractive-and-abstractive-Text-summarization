he predicted that the south african economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. mr manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. unveiling the 418bn rand budget to parliament, mr manuel said the south african economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the african average of 4%. in this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of south africa, said mr manuel. the tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand 1.2bn 910m . given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.
