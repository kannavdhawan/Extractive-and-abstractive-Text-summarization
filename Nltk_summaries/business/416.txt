overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case in 2005, said kurt karl, economist at swiss re in new york. steady job growth continues in us the us created fewer jobs than expected in december, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month to month basis. job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. a fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two thirds of all us economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.
