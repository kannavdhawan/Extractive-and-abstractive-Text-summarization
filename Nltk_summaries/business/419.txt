 1m payoff for former shell boss shell is to pay 1m 522 000 to the ex finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over stated its reserves. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had fooled the market about its reserves the investigation said she did nothing to inquire further. in all shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september it paid 82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves. the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman sir phil watts and production chief walter van der vijver. judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer.
