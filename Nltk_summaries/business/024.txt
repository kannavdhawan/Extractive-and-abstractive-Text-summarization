us trade gap hits record in 2004 the gap between us exports and imports hit an all time high of 671.7bn 484bn in 2004 latest figures show. the us consumer s appetite for all things from oil to imported cars and even wine and cheese reached record levels last year and the figures are likely to spark fresh criticism of president bush s economic policies. for example they believe china s currency policy which us manufacturers claim has undervalued the yuan by as much as 40 has given china s rapidly expanding economy an unfair advantage against us competitors. for all of 2004 us exports rose 12.3 to 1.15 trillion but imports rose even faster by 16.3 to a new record of 1.76 trillion. meanwhile the bush administration argues that the us deficit reflects the fact the america is growing at faster rate than the rest of the world spurring on more demand for imported goods.
