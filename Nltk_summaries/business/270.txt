oil prices reach three month low oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. however, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec's attitude to over production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. john person, president of national futures advisory services, said the eia data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the us. in london, the ftse 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. the long awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. the stronger fuel inventories helped boost us stock markets to nine month highs on wednesday, though only the nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of thursday. analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.
