oil prices reach three month low oil prices have fallen heavily for a second day closing at three month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter. in london the ftse 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4 751. the long awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. however some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec s attitude to over production leading to a scaling back of oil output. weak us fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. the falls were triggered when the energy information administration eia said on wednesday that us crude stocks were 3.5 higher than a year ago.
