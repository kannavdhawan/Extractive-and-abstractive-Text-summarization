egypt and israel seal trade deal in a sign of a thaw in relations between egypt and israel the two countries have signed a trade protocol with the us allowing egyptian goods made in partnership with israeli firms free access to american markets. products from these zones will enjoy duty free access to the us provided that 35 of their components are the product of israeli egyptian cooperation. the us describes this as the most important economic agreement between egypt and israel in two decades. there has been deep sensitivity in egypt about any form of co operation with israel as long as its peace process with the palestinians remains blocked. both exchanged prisoners earlier this month with egypt handing back an israeli who has served eight years in prison after being convicted for spying.
