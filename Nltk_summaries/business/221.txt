bp surges ahead on high oil price oil giant bp has announced a 26 rise in annual profits to 16.2bn 8.7bn on the back of record oil prices. speaking on the bbc s today programme on tuesday lord browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone. however lord browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company s huge profits saying that in the north sea it paid progressively more tax the more profits it made. bp put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil up 10 on 2003 but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for. lord browne pointed out that bp was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.
