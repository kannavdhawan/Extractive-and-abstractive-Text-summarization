china's shanda buys stake in sina chinese online game operator shanda interactive entertainment has bought a 20% stake in sina, the country's biggest internet portal firm. however, mr cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by beijing. there could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid, said wallace cheung, an analyst at dbs vickers. the move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better known international firm may also now show an interest in sina. the board of directors said in a statement that it would continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers . a merger would create a firm that offers online role playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.
