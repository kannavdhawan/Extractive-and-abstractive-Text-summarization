while the uk's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in germany, 10.4% in spain and 9.7% in france. but, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year.
