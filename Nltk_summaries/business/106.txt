gordon brown's decision to announce the date of the budget while on a trip to china was a sensible thing to do , since he was talking about skills and investment at the time, mr balls told the bbc. mr balls rejected the allegation that mr brown had been sidelined in the election campaign, saying he was playing a different role to the one he played in the last two elections. last july, mr balls won the right to step down from his treasury position and run for parliament, defending the labour stronghold of normanton in west yorkshire. commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise, he said it was not within the remit of the bank of england's monetary policy committee mpc to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. formerly one of mr brown's closest treasury aides, ed balls hinted at a budget giveaway on 16 march.
