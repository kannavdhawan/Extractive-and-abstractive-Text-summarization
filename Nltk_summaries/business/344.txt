the dollar has now fallen for a third consecutive year and analysts are forecasting a further, albeit less dramatic weakening, in 2005. i can see it finishing the year around 1.35 and we can see that it's going to be a steady track upward for the euro dollar in 2005, finishing the year around 1.40, said adrian hughes, currency strategist with hsbc in london. thursday's new low for the dollar came after data was released showing year on year sales of new homes in the us had fallen 12% in november with some analysts saying this could indicate problems ahead for consumer activity.
