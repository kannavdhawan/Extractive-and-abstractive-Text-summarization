last week, yukos filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the us in a last ditch attempt to hang on to yuganskneftegas, which accounts for 60% of its output. the sale has destroyed yukos, once the owner of yuganskneftegas, said founder mikhail khodorkovsky. it is a front for somebody but not necessarily for gazprom, said oleg maximov, an analyst at troika dialog in moscow. yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. menatep, yukos main shareholders' group, has also threatened legal action. one scenario is that baikal will not pay when it is supposed to in two weeks time, putting yuganskneftegas back in the hands of bailiffs and back within the reach of gazprom.
