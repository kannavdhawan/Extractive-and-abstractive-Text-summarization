the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than 200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would sunset , or disappear, in 2010. most republicans, however, want them to stay in place. however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to 3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government, mr bush said in his budget message to congress. bush budget seeks deep cutbacks president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at 427bn 230bn this year. the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.
