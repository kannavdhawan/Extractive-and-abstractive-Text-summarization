us airways staff agree to pay cut a union representing 5,200 flight attendants at bankrupt us airways have agreed to a new contract that cuts pay by nearly 10%. it had been one of the quickest to deal with difficulties faced by the aviation industry after the 9 11 attacks in 2001. but it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in march 2003 to face competition from low cost carriers and higher fuel costs. but talks are still continuing with a union representing mechanics, baggage handlers and cleaners, which has so far failed to negotiate a new contract. the deal will help the carrier, trying to survive by cutting costs by nearly 1bn 530m a year, save about 94m. us airways management has said it may need to start liquidating assets if it does not receive concessions from all staff by the middle of this month.
