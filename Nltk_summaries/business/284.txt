first rule of law, then the economy, says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. but some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded 22bn since june 2003. iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re opening of hospitals. yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. blackwatch's baghdad based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out. the economy has become the second most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post war iraq. an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles.
