a new york court ruled that former fbi man jeffrey royer, 41, fed damaging information to anthony elgindy, 36. mr elgindy then drove share prices lower by spreading negative publicity via his newsletter. under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, royer and elgindy used the fbi's crime fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public, said us attorney roslynn mauskopf. when the guilty verdict was announced by the jury foreman, mr elgindy dropped his face into his hands and sobbed, the associated press news agency reported. mr royer was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. defense lawyers contended that mr royer had been feeding information to mr elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. elgindy's conviction marks the end of his public charade as a crusader against fraud in the market, said ms mauskopf.
