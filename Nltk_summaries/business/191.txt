given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us, mr kim explained. merck voluntarily stopped sales of vioxx on 30 september, a move which caused the firm's fourth quarter earnings to slide to 1.1bn 581m , from 1.4bn a year earlier. the cox 2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including merck and pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers. european regulators, meanwhile, ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox 2 inhibitors. merck's head of research peter kim said that it withdrew vioxx based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies . on thursday, david graham from the fda's office of drug safety told the advisory panel that there really doesn't appear to be a need for cox 2 inhibitors.
