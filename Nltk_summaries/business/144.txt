oil prices fall back from highs oil prices retreated from four month highs in early trading on tuesday after producers' cartel opec said it was now unlikely to cut production. on monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four month high as cold weather in the us threatened stocks of heating oil. following the comments by acting opec secretary general adnan shihab eldin, us light crude fell 32 cents to 51.43 a barrel. us demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago. he said that high oil prices meant opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter.
