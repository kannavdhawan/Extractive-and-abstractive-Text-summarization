turkey iran mobile deal 'at risk' turkey's investment in iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by mps. turkish austrian consortium tav was chosen to build and run tehran's new imam khomeini international airport but the army closed it just hours after it opened in may 2004. in both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the turkish firms are too close to israel. although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought turkcell was set to pull out of the 3bn deal. iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. the possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero, said atinc ozkan, analyst at finans investment in istanbul.
