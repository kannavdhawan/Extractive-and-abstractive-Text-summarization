takeover offer for sunderland fc bob murray, chairman of sunderland fc, has launched a 1.5m 2.8m bid for the club after buying broadcaster bskyb's stake in the business. a lifetime sunderland supporter and board director since 1984, mr murray agreed to buy bskyb's 4.76% holding in the wearside club on tuesday taking his stake to 42.3%. mr murray is already sunderland's leading shareholder, holding a 37.6% stake, and now hopes to take full control of the championship side. under stock market rules, mr murray is required to make an offer for the remaining shares that he does not already own at the same price paid for the bskyb holding of 31p a share. however, the club's turnover dropped sharply from 42.5m to 28.5m over the same period, because of a fall in broadcast revenues. should the offer be fully accepted, mr murray said he expected to pay a maximum of 1.53m for the remaining shares.
