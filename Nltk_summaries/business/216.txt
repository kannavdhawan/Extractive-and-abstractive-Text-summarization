as chief operating officer, toshiyuki shiga will run nissan on a daily basis, although mr ghosn, who masterminded its recovery, will remain chief executive. dubbed 'le cost killer' for pushing through huge cost cuts in previous jobs, mr ghosn reduced nissan's overheads by 20% and trimmed its workforce by about 200,000 after taking charge in 1999. these actions helped nissan turn a 684bn yen 6.4bn loss in 2000 into a 331bn yen 2.7bn profit the following year.
