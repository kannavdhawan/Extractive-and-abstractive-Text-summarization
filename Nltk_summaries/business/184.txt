we have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of stuart rose's strategy of quality, style and price, said the m s spokesman. this was followed the same day by mark paulsmeier, a south african financier, issuing a press release saying his paulsmeier group was interested in m s. a sudden spike in m s's share price followed. separately, investment bank goldman sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 m s goods is now 11% above the high street average, compared with 43% higher last year. drkw said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term step change in pricing in certain areas at m s. either way, this cannot be good news for m s' margin, it added. it has been a strange week for m s, which on tuesday received a statement from philip green, the billionaire bhs owner, confirming he was not rebidding for the company. we are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid market retailers like next, said m s. next is one of m s's biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices.
