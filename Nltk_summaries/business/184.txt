we have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of stuart rose's strategy of quality, style and price, said the m s spokesman. this was followed the same day by mark paulsmeier, a south african financier, issuing a press release saying his paulsmeier group was interested in m s. a sudden spike in m s's share price followed. separately, investment bank goldman sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 m s goods is now 11% above the high street average, compared with 43% higher last year. drkw said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term step change in pricing in certain areas at m s. either way, this cannot be good news for m s' margin, it added. it has been a strange week for m s, which on tuesday received a statement from philip green, the billionaire bhs owner, confirming he was not rebidding for the company.
