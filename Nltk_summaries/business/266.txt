the case against yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. since yukos' founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the russian market has dropped by 10% an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance. after vladimir putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort too much, critics argue into enforcement. after mr putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers. an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount of dividends and other income outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation, the authors say.
