according to frank brown global advisory leader at pwc the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside one risk in one region for example the middle east won t kill your business anymore. but pwc s global chief executive samuel dipiazza said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers. euro firms miss out on optimism more than 90 of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects a survey of 1 300 bosses suggests. possibly as a result the worry about low cost competition has slightly fallen from last year with just 54 of companies calling it a significant threat or one of the biggest threats . mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had adjusted to the new reality of a euro that buys 1.30 and more while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.
