according to frank brown, global advisory leader at pwc , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside one risk in one region for example the middle east won't kill your business anymore. surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third largest problem. but pwc's global chief executive, samuel dipiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers. possibly as a result, the worry about low cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a significant threat or one of the biggest threats . already, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. across europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs.
