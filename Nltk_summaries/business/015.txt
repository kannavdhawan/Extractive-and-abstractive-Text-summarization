we reckon it's going to cost european air passengers not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers 1.5bn euros, that's over 1bn a year loaded onto european passengers, mr clarke said. andy clarke, eraa director of air transport, said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather. air passengers win new eu rights air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. on wednesday, jacques barrot, vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport, said that the changes were necessary. it's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this, ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio 4's today programme. in addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.
