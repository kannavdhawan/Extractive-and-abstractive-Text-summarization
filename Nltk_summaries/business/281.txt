regular annual bonus rates on former axa equity law with profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. the cut will hit an estimated 3% of axa's policyholders. the stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002, axa spokesman mark hamilton, axa spokesman, told bbc news.
