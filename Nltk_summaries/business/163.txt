but core producer prices, which exclude food and energy costs, surged by 0.8%, the biggest rise since december 1998, increasing inflationary concerns. however on friday, it was overshadowed by the core ppi core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year on year gain in nine years. the mixed set of data on friday led to volatile early wall street trade, as the dow jones, standard and poor's 500, and nasdaq swung between positive and negative territory. one time increases in alcohol and tobacco prices, which are no indication of broad ppi pressure , were responsible for the increase, he said. the concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core ppi as an impetus for the fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates, said paul cherney, chief market analyst at standard poor's. the ppi would argue for greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace, said joe quinlan, chief market stategist at bank of america capital management.
