this is due largely to the faltering german economy, which shrank 0.2% in the last quarter of 2004. on monday, germany's bdb private banks association said the german economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005. separately, the bundesbank warned that germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of gdp presented huge risks given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. the uk economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%.
