eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals, including a tax on jet fuel, to boost development aid for poorer nations. of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives, but why target the airlines said ulrich schulte strathaus, secretary general of the association of european airlines. the world's richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy. the eu sought to allay the airlines' fears, stressing that thursday's meeting was only a first step and that other proposals were also under consideration. at present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states. at their meeting in london, g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.
