eu aiming to fuel development aid european union finance ministers meet on thursday to discuss proposals including a tax on jet fuel to boost development aid for poorer nations. the world s richest countries have said they want to increase the amount of aid they give to 0.7 of their annual gross national income by 2015. airlines have reacted strongly against the proposed fuel levy. of course we applaud humanitarian initiatives but why target the airlines said ulrich schulte strathaus secretary general of the association of european airlines. at present the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in eu member states. there is thought to be widespread support for the plan tabled by france and germany following the recent g7 meeting of the world s richest nations from eu ministers.
