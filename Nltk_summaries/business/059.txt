the prosecution's star witness, former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan, has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to hit our books . but ms cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom's accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a green light to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. cynthia cooper, worldcom's ex head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an 11bn 5.7bn accounting fraud. however, ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned anything uncomfortable about worldcom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates.
