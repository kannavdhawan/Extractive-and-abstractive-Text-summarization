mitsubishi in peugeot link talks trouble hit mitsubishi motors is in talks with french carmaker psa peugeot citroen about a possible alliance. on tuesday mitsubishi, the only major japanese car firm in the red, confirmed earlier reports of negotiations. mitsubishi's sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. the us german firm, once a majority shareholder, decided last april to stop providing financial backing. analysts said that alliances with other carmakers would be a necessary part of whatever it came up with, not least because its own slow sales have left its manufacturing capacity under used. but a spokesman refused to comment on speculation that mitsubishi could end up building cars for psa and perhaps its japanese rival nissan.
