instead, gm swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of fiat and gave fiat a put option to sell gm the rest of the car maker between january 2004 and july 2009. but despite the alliance fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share. gm pays 2bn to evade fiat buyout general motors of the us is to pay fiat 1.55bn euros 2bn 1.1bn to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian car maker outright. we needed scale in europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with fiat, said gm chief executive rick wagoner. the relationship soured further after fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving gm's stake to 10%. fiat's shares on the milan stock exchange rose 4.5% by 0900 gmt to 6.2 euros, having shot up more than 7% in early trading.
