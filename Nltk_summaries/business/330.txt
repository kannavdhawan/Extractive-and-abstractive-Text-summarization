the argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy, thomas dawson, an imf director, said earlier this month. locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now, he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re opening. the unemployment rate is improving, too it is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in may 2002. true, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. few people have recovered more than about half their savings, mr baez silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, was fortunate at the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina, said carlos baez silva, president of aara, an association that represents bank account and bond holders.
