the warning of a five cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival's share price, from 35 to 36.20. other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 gmt carnival's shares in london were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at 32.26. why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time, says deutsche bank's simon champion. despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, slowing supply growth is a certainty, said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. assuming that citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in carnival's favour. that should mitigate some of the pr risk, both for carnival and its main competitor, royal caribbean.
