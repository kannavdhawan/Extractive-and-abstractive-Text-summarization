us budget deficit to reach 368bn the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse than expected 368bn 197bn this year, officials said on tuesday. the budget deficit hit a record 412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004, after reaching 377bn in the previous fiscal year. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. however, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential 2 3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further 100bn in the red.
