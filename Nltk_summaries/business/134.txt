in addition, the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months to 139,000 in september instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in august instead of 128,000. the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york, with the main dow jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. kathleen utgoff, commissioner of the bureau of labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean up work in florida, and neighbouring deep south states, following four hurricanes in august and september. the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the us's record trade deficit. it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year, said economist gary thayer of ag edwards sons. us adds more jobs than expected the us economy added 337,000 jobs in october a seven month high and far more than wall street expectations. in a welcome economic boost for newly re elected president george w bush, the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains.
