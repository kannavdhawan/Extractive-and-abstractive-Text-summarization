shares in germany's thyssenkrupp, the uk's corus and france's arcleor fell while japan's nippon steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. china's baoshan iron and steel co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. steel analyst peter fish, director of sheffield based consulting group meps, said the extent of cvrd's price rise was uncharted territory , adding that the steel industry hasn't seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years .
