when it was launched, the cheapest mini cost just more than 10,000. these days, buyers will have to fork out almost 11,500 to own a new mini one, or even more for the cooper s which costs up to 17,730. the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to 15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. last year, mg rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation saic that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. in 1999, when bmw still owned rover, the oxford factory was producing the award winning rover 75. during that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. the risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle, said brad wernle, from automotive news europe.
