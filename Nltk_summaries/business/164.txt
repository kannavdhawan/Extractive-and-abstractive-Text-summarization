yukos sues four firms for 20bn russian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year s forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas. the clash between yukos and the kremlin came to a head last year when yukos was hit with a bill of more than 27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom its unit gazpromneft investment company baikal and state oil firm rosneft. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies while moscow officials have dismissed yukos legal wrangling as meaningless. the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last year s auction however.
