the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom, its unit gazpromneft, investment company baikal, and state oil firm rosneft. rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with gazprom, bringing a large chunk of russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos sues four firms for 20bn russian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas. mr khodorkovsky, once russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail. concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and yuganskneftegas was sold to little known investment firm baikal finance group. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies, while moscow officials have dismissed yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless.
