meanwhile, tim osborne, head of yukos main shareholders' group menatep, said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside russia, against the auction winners. and, according to tass news agency, gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep, a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. the protection, if recognised by the russian authorities, would have allowed yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.
