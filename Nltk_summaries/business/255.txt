call to overhaul uk state pension the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think tank. the report added that a combination of higher taxes higher savings and or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis. the think tank s proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission s initial report into uk retirement savings. the pensions policy institute ppi said replacing the state pension with a citizen s pension would help tackle inequality and complexity. the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance ni contributions.
