it expects a series of aggressive interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy, mr bootle. 'golden economic period' to end ten years of golden economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, city consultancy deloitte has warned. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below chancellor gordon brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. in its quarterly economic review, deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a golden period during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s. whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%.
