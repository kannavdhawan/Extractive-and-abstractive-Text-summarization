christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981. retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december, after a 0.6% rise in november, the office for national statistics ons said. the retail sales figures are very weak, but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter, said mr shaw. yet, other retailers including hmv, monsoon, jessops, body shop and tesco reported that festive sales were well up on last year. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non seasonally adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. morrisons, woolworths, house of fraser, marks spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending, an indication that consumers are looking for bargains, and retailers are cutting their prices.
