christmas sales worst since 1981 uk retail sales fell in december failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981. retail sales dropped by 1 on the month in december after a 0.6 rise in november the office for national statistics ons said. the retail sales figures are very weak but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night you don t really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter said mr shaw. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures pointing out that the non seasonally adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. clothing retailers and non specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth according to the ons.
