why few targets are better than many the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world's leading economy by 2010. but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. the lisbon vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change, said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council, a brussels based citizen action group. it's very ambitious, said john palmer, political director at the european policy centre, a brussels based think tank. that's why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission, jose manuel barroso, to adopt mr kok's recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.
