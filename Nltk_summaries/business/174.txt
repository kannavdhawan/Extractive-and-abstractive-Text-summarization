yangtze electric's profits double yangtze electric power, the operator of china's three gorges dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004. the firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the three gorges dam, as well as a power station on its sister xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 365m 190m , compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier. its sister project, the xiluodu dam, is being built on the jinshajiang or river of golden sand as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. the figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%. the three gorges dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.
