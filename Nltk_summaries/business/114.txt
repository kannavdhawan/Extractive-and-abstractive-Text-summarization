in the new york court on wednesday, mr ebbers' lawyer reid weingarten asked mr sullivan if you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right on that date, yes. mr weingarten has suggested that mr sullivan is implicating mr ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something mr sullivan denies.
