in the new york court on wednesday, mr ebbers' lawyer reid weingarten asked mr sullivan if you believe something is in your interest, you are willing and able to lie to accomplish it, isn't that right on that date, yes. mr weingarten has suggested that mr sullivan is implicating mr ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something mr sullivan denies. mr sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following mr ebbers' trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. mr sullivan also rejects a suggestion that he had once told fellow worldcom board member bert roberts that mr ebbers was unaware of the accounting fraud at worldcom. under 23 hours of questioning from a federal prosecutor, mr sullivan has previously told the court that he repeatedly warned mr ebbers that falsifying the books would be the only way to meet wall street revenue and earnings expectations. mr ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in worldcom's finances.
