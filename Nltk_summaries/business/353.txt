the region that's affected is very big so we have to check country by country what the situation is , said serge troeber, deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re, the world's second biggest reinsurance firm. many of the worst hit areas, such as sri lanka, thailand's phuket island and the maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support, while indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from imf assistance. the worst hit areas are sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, with at least 23,000 people killed. i should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us, he said.
