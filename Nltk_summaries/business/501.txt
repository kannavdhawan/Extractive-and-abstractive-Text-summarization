water firm suez in argentina row a conflict between the argentine state and water firm aguas argentinas, controlled by france's suez, is casting doubt on the firm's future. but last week, argentine economic minister, roberto lavagna, told the french media in paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a state contribution to aguas argentinas infrastructure investments. in argentina, suez's subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the argentine government. however, aguas argentinas told the argentine newspaper clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out state participation on its board. during the last financial crisis in argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from us dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations.
