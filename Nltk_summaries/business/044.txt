japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. figures released by the government's cabinet office showed that gdp, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year.
