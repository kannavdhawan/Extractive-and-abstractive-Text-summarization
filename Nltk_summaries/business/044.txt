japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. figures released by the government's cabinet office showed that gdp, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. on wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips japan into recession. gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy, said naoki iizuka, senior economist at the dai ichi life research institute.
