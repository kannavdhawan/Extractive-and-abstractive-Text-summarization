gerrard, who fired liverpool into the last 16 of this season's competition with a brilliant goal in december's win over olympiakos, insisted he was still fully focused on helping liverpool to glory this season. we are confident we can upset chelsea in the carling cup final and get to the last eight of the champions league because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good. the reds are currently fifth in the premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings champions league qualification and they face chelsea in sunday's carling cup final. rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind right now , he told bbc radio five live. let's be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the champions league, he told bbc radio five live.
