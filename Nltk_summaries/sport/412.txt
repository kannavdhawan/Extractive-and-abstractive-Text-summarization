france , ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year's rbs six nations, with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby. if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on, a solid defence and a team who play for their lives, we can achieve something, dominici added. dominici backs lacklustre france wing christophe dominici says france can claim another six nations grand slam despite two lacklustre wins so far against scotland and england. in the backs, centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury, while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call up as a replacement for pepito elhorga. the english played better than us but lost, whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam, said dominici. we know our display was not perfect, but we can still win the grand slam, along with ireland and wales.
