campbell to be lions consultant former government communications chief alastair campbell will act as a media consultant to sir clive woodward s 2005 lions on their tour to new zealand. woodward s decision to call in prime minister tony blair s former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last lions tour of australia in 2001 when new zealander graham henry was the head coach. his role is to work closely with not only myself but tour manager bill beaumont media manager louisa cheetham and team manager louise ramsay. campbell who left downing street earlier this year will advise on media strategy before and during the tour. i hope i can contribute to the planning and preparation and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself he said.
