iranian misses israel match iranian striker vahid hashemian will not travel to israel for bayern munich's champions league match against maccabi tel aviv on wednesday. a bayern spokesman said on monday that the decision not to take hashemian to israel had been motivated only by his physical condition. iran refuses to recognise israel's right to exist and does not allow its citizens to travel to the country. iran gave judo world champion arash miresmaeili a 125,000 reward when he refused to fight an israeli at the athens olympics. he's got back pain and he couldn't train, the spokesman said. the international judo federation considered taking action against miresmaeili but concluded he had been overweight for the fight and could not have taken part.
