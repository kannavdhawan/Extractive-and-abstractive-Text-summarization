cole faces lengthy injury lay off aston villa's carlton cole could be out for six weeks with a knee injury. cole, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because o'leary had a shortage of strikers. the striker, who is on a season long loan from chelsea, picked up the knock in an england under 21 match against holland earlier this month. the return to fitness of darius vassell after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of luke moore has alleviated some of the villa's manager's problems in that department. carlton will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge, said villa boss david o'leary.
