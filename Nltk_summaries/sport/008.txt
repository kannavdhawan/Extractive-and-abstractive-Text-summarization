moore said he is confident hansen can make it back to top level competition, though it is unclear if that will be in time for the commonwealth games in melbourne next march, when she will be 34. it's been a frustrating time for her, but it has not fazed her determination, he added. hansen, the commonwealth and european champion, has been sidelined since the european cup in poland in june 2004. it was hoped she would be able to return this summer, but the wound from the injury has been very slow to heal.
