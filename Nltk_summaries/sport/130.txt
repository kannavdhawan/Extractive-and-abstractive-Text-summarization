weir poised for sunderland move larne s teenage star robbie weir is poised to join sunderland after turning down a move to stoke city. personally i would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full time game. the 17 year old irish league midfielder was also being chased by rangers and fulham but mick mccarthy s side appear to have won the race. but larne boss jimmy mcgeough has yet to confirm that weir is on his way from inver park. but it would be great to see him making it at sunderland.
