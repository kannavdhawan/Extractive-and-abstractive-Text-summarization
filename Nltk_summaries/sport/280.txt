mourinho takes swipe at arsenal chelsea boss jose mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals arsenal ahead of the gunners facing newcastle on wednesday. chelsea boss jose mourinho admitted his side were lucky to win at fratton park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year. he added we have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and although i understand the traditions of football here at this time of year it is not good for your health to do it. arsenal will play the magpies a day after chelsea beat portsmouth during a busy festive programme. and mourinho said they always seem to have two or three days rest in which to recover.
