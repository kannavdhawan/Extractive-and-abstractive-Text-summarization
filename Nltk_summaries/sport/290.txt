ireland captain brian o'driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said we are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. byrne said it was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. o'gara revels in ireland victory ireland fly half ronan o'gara hailed his side's 19 13 victory over england as a special win. andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldn't see whether he was offside or not so i don't know how andy could have known, said o'sullivan. i think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while. ireland coach eddie o'sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break.
