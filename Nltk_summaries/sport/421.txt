henman overcomes rival rusedski tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski 4 6 7 6 8 6 6 4 at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday. rusedski had match point at 6 5 in the second set tie break after henman double faulted but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set. rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years. it was the first match between the pair for three years henman last lost to rusedski six years ago and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals rather than as team mates after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on 4 6 march.
