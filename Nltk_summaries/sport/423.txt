ferrero eyes return to top form former world number one juan carlos ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005. the 2003 french open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. the 25 year old spaniard joins a top field for the abn amro world tennis tournament in rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. he opens against rainer schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed david nalbandian in the second round. it was difficult because i had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that i would play, said ferrero. among the low points of a difficult year for ferrero was the decision of spain captain jordi arrese to drop him for the davis cup final against the usa. physically i am 100% since december of last year, said ferrero. despite this, ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season.
