kerr frustrated at victory margin republic of ireland manager brian kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over croatia. the republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since kerr succeeded mick mccarthy. robbie keane took his republic record to 24 with a first half goal which proved enough for victory. brian kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young stephen elliott getting a run out. but, given the conditions and the standard of the croatian team, we should be very happy with the win. it is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team, said kerr.
