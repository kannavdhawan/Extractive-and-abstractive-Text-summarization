ref stands by scotland decisions the referee from saturday's france v scotland six nations match has defended the officials' handling of the game after criticism by matt williams. but nigel williams told the scottish daily mail i spoke to matt williams at the post match dinner. meanwhile, matt williams will not be punished by the scottish rugby union for allegedly using bad language in his comments about the officials. the scotland coach said his side were robbed of victory by poor decisions made by the officials. ultimately there is a match assessor at every international game to give an impartial and objective view of the performance of the officials. if matt has issues with the match officials, then he is very welcome to phone me and discuss them.
