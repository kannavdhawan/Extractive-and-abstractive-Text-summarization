i didn't expect that to win the 2000 us open it was against sampras, i wasn't the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever, he said. after the first final that i didn't win against thomas johansson in 2002 , i couldn't see myself winning the grand slams anymore. i feel like i can't waste my time, my energy on that surface, he said. at least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance, he said. i was like really much i was much happier than in 2000, that's for sure, because i get over it.
