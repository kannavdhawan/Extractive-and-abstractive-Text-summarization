charvis set to lose fitness bid flanker colin charvis is unlikely to play any part in wales' final two games of the six nations. centre parker has only a slim chance of being involved against the scots on 13 march, so luscombe's return to fitness after missing the france match with hamstring trouble is a timely boost. he will not figure in the scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game, said wales physio mark davies. we're getting that reviewed and we should know more by the end of the week how robin's looking, added johnson. said wales assistant coach scott johnson we're positive about hal and hope he'll be raring to go. sonny parker is continuing to struggle with a neck injury, but hal luscombe should be fit for the murrayfield trip.
