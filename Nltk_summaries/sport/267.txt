robertson out to retain euro lure hearts manager john robertson hopes a place in the knock out stages of the uefa cup could help keep some of his out of contract players at the club. it s very much the player s prerogative but the fact that we ve been playing european football for the last three or four years is obviously an incentive added robertson. but we want players who want to play for the football club who are committed and a run in europe always helps a little bit. but he added if tynecastle could have hosted 30 000 it would have been fantastic but that s one of the benefits of murrayfield it allows us to bring even more of our supporters into it. with the game being played at murrayfield instead of tynecastle because of uefa regulations robertson sees both positive and negative aspects to the change of venue.
