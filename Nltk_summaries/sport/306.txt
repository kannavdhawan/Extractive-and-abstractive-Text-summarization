forwards nicolas mas, sylvain marconnet, olivier milloud, william servat, sebastien bruno, fabien pelous, jerome thion, gregory lamboley, serge betsen, julien bonnaire, sebastien chabal, yannick nyanga. backs dimitri yachvili, pierre mignoni, frederic michalak, yann delaigue, damien traille, brian liebenberg, jean philippe grandclaude, christophe dominici, jimmy marlu, pepito elhorga. if he was to be suspended, we would call up imanol harinordoquy or thomas lievremont, said laporte, who has dropped patrick tabacco. but the player, who missed the victory over scotland through injury, must attend a disciplinary hearing on wednesday after being cited by wasps. france's regular back row combination of betsen, harinordoquy and olivier magne were all missing from france's side at the weekend because of injury. the trio have been called up after pieter de villiers, ludovic valbon and aurelien rougerie all picked up injuries in france's 16 9 win on saturday.
