yes, samaria let kelly get away, but there was no coming back over the last 200m as kelly dominated the race, so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly. agnes samaria, who came second, is in very good shape and is in the world's top three 800m runners this season. record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record, but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham. from an international perspective, i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the 3,000m, but i don't think the pace making was great. apparently, isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time.
