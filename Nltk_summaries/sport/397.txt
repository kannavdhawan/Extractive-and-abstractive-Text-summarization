sean long, sculthorpe's saints and lions team mate, has expressed doubts about his international future i think sean's situation is to do with the sheer number of games we're playing, he said. the 27 year old, who captained st helens to challenge cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of farrell would be a challenge. st helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward sonny bill williams, and sculthorpe said he would love the 19 year old to come to knowsley road. he's a great player a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful, he said. if he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play.
