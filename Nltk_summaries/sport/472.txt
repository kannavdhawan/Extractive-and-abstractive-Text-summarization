bryan twins keep us hopes alive the united states kept the davis cup final alive with victory in saturday's doubles rubber, leaving spain 2 1 ahead going into the final day. it feels good, but it's not going to be as good if we don't win two tomorrow, said mike bryan. masters cup champions mike and bob bryan thrashed juan carlos ferrero and tommy robredo 6 0 6 3 6 2 in front of a partisan crowd in seville. he was replaced by former world number one ferrero, but the spanish pair were out of their depth against one of the world's best doubles teams. ferrero, who was upset to be dropped for friday's singles, hinted at further dissatisfaction after the defeat. when robredo dropped serve in the opening game of the third set the match was all but over, and the unflappable bryan brothers powered on to an impressive win.
