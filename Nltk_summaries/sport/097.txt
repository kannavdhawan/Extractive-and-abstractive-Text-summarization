the club website also reported that beattie, who seemed unrepentant after saturday's match, insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him, has now apologised. speaking immediately after the game, moyes said i don't think it was a sending off, i have been a centre half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.
