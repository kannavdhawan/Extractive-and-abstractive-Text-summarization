sunday's explosive six nations clash at lansdowne road was a good example as ireland took another step towards their first grand slam since 1948. the game was as exciting as it comes, with a much improved england side enraged at a few decisions that did not go their way. there was no doubt that ireland had the rub of the green in their 19 13 victory, but the reaction from the england camp may not have endeared them to the sport's blazers . brian o'driscoll's winning try was as well conceived as they come, while charlie hodgson's brilliant kicking display was another highlight. as far as england were concerned, there were queries over mark cueto's first half effort when he went over in the corner from a charlie hodgson kick. that spoke volumes about ireland's back foot display, with defensive coach mike ford taking a bow at the end. on that occasion, david humphreys kicked to tommy bowe, who touched down in the corner only for the try to be wiped out.
