davies favours gloucester future wales hooker mefin davies is likely to stay with english side gloucester despite reported interest from the neath swansea ospreys. although he got match time with the ospreys at the request of the wales management he admitted before his move to gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated. the summer demise of the celtic warriors region left davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi professional contract with neath rfc. it was a hard time throughout the summer then deciding whether to accept an offer from stade francais which would have ended my wales career. bbc wales understands the ospreys are interested in the 32 year old but that he would prefer to stay where he is.
