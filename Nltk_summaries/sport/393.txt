bath faced with tindall ultimatum mike tindall's agent has warned bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the england man or risk losing him to a rival club. tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that brownsword is unwilling to break the club's salary structure to accommodate the 26 year old's demands. dipo alli says he has received an offer for tindall which dwarfs bath's deal and that two other clubs want to talk. mike does not want to go into the six nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season, alli told the guardian newspaper. mike has been at bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive, the agent added.
