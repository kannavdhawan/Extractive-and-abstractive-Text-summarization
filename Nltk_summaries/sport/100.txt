mido's apology today does not negatively affect mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players, shalaby said. mido said there isn't much i have to say today, all there is to say is that i came specially from england to egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes.
