ferdinand casts doubt over glazer rio ferdinand has said he is unsure of malcolm glazer s motives after the american billionaire launched a new offer to buy manchester united. glazer currently owns a 28.1 stake in the club and united s statement to the stock exchange said the board has noted the recent press speculation on this subject. glazer s previous bids for the club which united supporters opposed were rejected by the board because of the high level of debt they would incur. the board can confirm that it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various pre conditions which may form the basis of an offer for manchester united from glazer. a lot of people want the club s interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and have got its interests at heart said ferdinand.
