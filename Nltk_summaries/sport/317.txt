munster cup tie switched to spain munster's heineken cup quarter final tie against biarritz on 3 april has been switched to real sociedad's paseo de anoeta stadium in san sebastian. real's ground holds 32,000 whereas the parc des sports aguilera in biarritz has a capacity of just 12,667. the irish province will be given at least 8,000 tickets. the match will be the first heineken cup fixture to be played in spain, and is expected to attract the biggest ever attendance for a rugby match in the country. the decision to move was a difficult one, but as we considered the fans as one of our primary objectives, said biarritz chairman marcel martin. ulster were the last irish team to play at the paseo de anoeta stadium where they faced a euskarians side during a pre season tour in 1998. we hope we will be rewarded as a huge crowd behaving in the best rugby tradition.
