he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build up to wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson's cross kick into touch, all inside the first quarter. tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy. up front, the line out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from chris jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody. robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to england's future. tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular.
