the baa baas did threaten, scoring tries through albert van den bergh, xavier rush and andrea lo cicero, but never looked like winning. burger, 21, was recently crowned player of the year by both his peers and the international rugby board, but has struggled for form in recent weeks. the hosts failed to ignite in the second half and, the moment gear scored his second just after the interval, there was only ever going to be one winner. the all blacks featured only two of the side which started last weekend's emphatic test victory over france in paris, while the baa baas had nine wallabies in their starting line up. lo cicero, the sole european for the barbarians, bundled over for a try to briefly curtail the deficit. jermoe keino and piri weepu both added tries to the all blacks' tally before the final whistle, while van den bergh gained some consolation for the baa baas.
