i haven't heard a bad word said against trevor, which, considering he has a pretty tough guy reputation, is, to me, impressive. woodward eyes brennan for lions toulouse's former irish international trevor brennan could be one of clive woodward's many surprises when the 44 man lions tour squad is announced. i've spoken to quite a few players, and they probably don't know what they're actually saying when we're having these conversations, he told the newspaper. brennan, who last played for ireland against samoa in 2001, is held in high esteem by the former england coach. if you speak to the players there's a huge amount of respect for the guy, woodward told the sunday independent. the 31 year old former dublin milkman moved from leinster to toulouse in 2003 and immediately picked up a heineken cup winner's medal in an all french final against perpignan at lansdowne road.
