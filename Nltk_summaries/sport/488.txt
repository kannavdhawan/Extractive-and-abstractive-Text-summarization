the 2003 champion claimed her seventh grand slam title, and her first since wimbledon in 2003, 2 6 6 3 6 0. williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. she quickly dropped the first set but from 3 3 in the second found another gear as davenport's game collapsed, allowing williams to take the title. davenport paid tribute to williams, saying she's had a tough couple of years and she's come back like a champion. despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at 3 3, but from 40 0 up she just folded. lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back, thank goodness, she said.
