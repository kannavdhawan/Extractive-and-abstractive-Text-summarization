luton, preston, queens park rangers and other clubs used to have plastic pitches during the the 1980s but, after a two year study, uefa insists the surfaces have moved on. uefa spokesman rob faulkner said people in england have bad memories of the artificial pitches of luton and qpr in the 1980s, but the latest generation are completely different and are much more like grass. uefa approves fake grass uefa says it will allow european matches to be played on artificial pitches from the start of next season. several leading clubs from scandinavia, russia and eastern europe especially those who only play champions league or uefa cup matches in winter are now expected to instal artificial pitches. international matches can also be played on such pitches, although games at major tournaments have to be contested on grass.
