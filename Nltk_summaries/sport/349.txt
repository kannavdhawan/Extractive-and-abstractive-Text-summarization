the two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 march at twickenham and kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of england's current slump. england have now equalled an 18 year low of four successive championship defeats, including france in paris last season, and have lost four in a row under andy robinson. england, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee jonathan kaplan not gone against them in the second half in dublin. first mark cueto was judged offside as he chased fly half charlie hodgson's kick, and then kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if josh lewsey had touched down after being driven over ireland's line. his predecessor, sir clive woodward, began his seven year reign with three defeats and two draws.
