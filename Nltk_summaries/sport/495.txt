with his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31 year old's career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long recognised promise in 2004, with myskina, maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams, before taking the season ending fed cup. with the russians still improving, the likes of henin hardenne, clijsters, davenport, mauresmo, venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men's side. a virus ruined the rest of henin hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win olympic gold, but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence, myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all russian final at the french open. the only major let down was a third round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open, and roland garros will be his main target in 2005. there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games, which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold.
