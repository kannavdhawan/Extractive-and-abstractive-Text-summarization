benitez added benitez said we had a problem before the start, it was decided that xabi could not play more than 45 minutes. benitez delight after crucial win liverpool manager rafael benitez admitted victory against deportivo la coruna was vital in their tight champions league group. benitez added it is all back in our own hands now, it was a great win for us and i was delighted with what i feel was the best liverpool i have seen. igor biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured xabi alonso, and benitez said he played very well. as far as i am concerned it is important for liverpool to win, it is not important in what country it is in. i want to see us win away matches in the champions league, that it was in spain was not my first consideration.
