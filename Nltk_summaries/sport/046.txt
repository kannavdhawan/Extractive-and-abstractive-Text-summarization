radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs paula radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals. this means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. it not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public. doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such, the 30 year old told the sunday times.
