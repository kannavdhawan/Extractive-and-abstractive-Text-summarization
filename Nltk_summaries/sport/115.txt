we have massive games coming up manchester city this week, then the everton cup tie, followed by ac milan in the champions league, and my first wales game under john toshack, so it's an important time. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17 year old in 1991, an away loss to germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed.
