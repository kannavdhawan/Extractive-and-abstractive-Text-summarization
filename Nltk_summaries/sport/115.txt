we have massive games coming up manchester city this week, then the everton cup tie, followed by ac milan in the champions league, and my first wales game under john toshack, so it's an important time. the manchester united winger won his first cap as a 17 year old in 1991, an away loss to germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. with giggs leading wales out against hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to speed. for this particular game i think it is appropriate that ryan giggs will be captain, it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that, toshack said. on wednesday night toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing hughes, and giggs said it's my 50th cap and i am looking forward to it, and i hope to play a lot more times from here on in. he feels, like myself, that i have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years' time i will be able to play in the european finals if we get there.
