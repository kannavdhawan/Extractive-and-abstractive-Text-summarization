philippoussis doubt over open bid mark philippoussis is almost certain to miss the australian open after suffering a groin injury during the hopman cup loss to the netherlands. former world number two tommy haas is also a doubt for the australian open after picking up a thigh injury playing for germany in the hopman cup. the injury is more common in australian rules football and a fit footballer would normally take three to four weeks to recover fully although mark s injury is slightly different. the 26 year old had treatment on his left thigh while leading argentine guillermo coria 7 5 2 2. he played one more game but his movement was hampered and he quit. it would be very unlikely in my opinion for him to do a five setter once let alone two days in a row inside two weeks.
