everton's weir cools euro hopes everton defender david weir has played down talk of european football, despite his team lying in second place in the premiership after beating liverpool. weir told bbc radio five live we don't want to rest on our laurels and say we have achieved anything yet. also injuries and suspensions haven't cost us too badly and we have a lot of self belief around the place. i think you start taking your eye off the ball if you make statements and look too far into the future. if you start making predictions you soon fall back into trouble. he said we are looking after each other and hard work goes a long way in this league.
