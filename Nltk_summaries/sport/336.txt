corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways. but corry has backed robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly half jonny wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to ireland. if you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15. it's a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us. every week my respect for him goes up, corry told bbc radio five live. a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time, especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. after losses to wales and france, critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full back.
