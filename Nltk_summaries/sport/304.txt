our first aim was to get gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we'll talk about in selection this week, wales coach mike ruddock told bbc sport wales. double injury blow strikes wales wales centre sonny parker and number eight ryan jones will miss saturday's game with italy because of injury. first choice kicker stephen jones handed over responsibility because of henson's greater kicking range, but the fly half had already missed a number of shots at goal. the centre was wales' hero in the 11 9 six nations win over england, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. meanwhile, mike ruddock may make gavin henson his first choice kicker in rome. parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over england, and tom shanklin is expected to continue at centre.
