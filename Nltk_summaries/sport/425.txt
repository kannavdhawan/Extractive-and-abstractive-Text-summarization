swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6 3. the match was a re run of last week's final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam, where federer triumphed, but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. i really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and i did, and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm, federer said.
