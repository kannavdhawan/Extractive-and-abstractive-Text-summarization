old firm pair handed suspensions celtic's henri camara and nacho novo of rangers have both been suspended for offences missed by the referee in a recent old firm game. i don't know if there's a lot to add to that, said rangers manager alex mcleish of novo's punishment. meanwhile, bob malcolm and rangers have been informed by letter as to the outcome of the hearing regarding his reaction to rangers being awarded a penalty in the same game. the additional bans come into effect from 28 december meaning camara will also be unavailable for the home game against livingston while novo will miss the meetings with dundee united and dunfermline. both players will miss this weekend's games when celtic host dundee united and rangers visit kilmarnock unless they decide to appeal. malcolm, a substitute on the day, was taken from the rangers dug out and spoken to by police about an alleged gesture he made.
