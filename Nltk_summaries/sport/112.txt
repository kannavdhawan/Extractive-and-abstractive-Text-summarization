but parry, speaking exclusively to bbc sport, also admits gerrard, who has been constantly linked with chelsea, will have the final say on his future. quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the agm in december, and as i have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. some liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but parry countered i recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for liverpool's new stadium in stanley park, which is set to open in 2007. and he confessed arsenal's 100m deal with emirates to sponsor their new ground complete with naming rights has given the anfield club serious food for thought. as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really 50m for gerrard i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. and responding to criticism from bbc sport pundit and former liverpool stalwart alan hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan steve morgan.
