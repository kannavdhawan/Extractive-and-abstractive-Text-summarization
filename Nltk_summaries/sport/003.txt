greene sets sights on world title maurice greene aims to wipe out the pain of losing his olympic 100m title in athens by winning a fourth world championship crown this summer. i believe that's what put me in lane seven in the final and, while i was in lane seven, i couldn't feel anything in the race. greene was also denied olympic gold in the 4x100m men's relay when he could not catch britain's mark lewis francis on the final leg. greene crossed the line just 0.02 seconds behind gatlin, who won in 9.87 seconds in one of the closest and fastest sprints of all time. i lost because of the things i did, said greene, who races in birmingham on friday.
