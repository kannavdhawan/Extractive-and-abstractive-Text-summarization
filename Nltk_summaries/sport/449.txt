while murray has been marked out as britain's golden boy, bogdanovic was warned by the lawn tennis association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. and bailey said despite that, alex is clearly talented as well, while arvind is another contender. britain's next opponents, israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4 6 march match against a likely trio of bogdanovic, murray and the 187th ranked arvind parmar. bogdanovic, three years murray's senior, has had a more troubled time under britain's davis cup umbrella. of those lining up to replace henman, the 17 year old murray, with four futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long term bet. and great britain's last davis cup win without henman came against slovenia as far back as 1996. worse could follow, according to former british team member chris bailey. the yugoslavian born bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties winning one and losing the other.
