ireland have finished runners up three times, including last year, since the old five nations became six in 2000, and not finished outside the top three in the past five years. ireland's last game of the tournament is against wales in cardiff a fixture they have not lost since 1983. but despite their traditional hospitality when the irish are visiting, wood believes wales might end their four match losing run against england in cardiff. wood ireland can win grand slam former captain keith wood believes ireland can win only their second grand slam and first since 1948 in this year's rbs six nations championship. for ireland to win it we need to stay relatively injury free, and fortunately we are one of the few teams that have done that so far, wood added. so many of the major england players have either retired in the last year or are injured that i think it will be very hard for them down in cardiff, wood added. wales have had four brilliant games in the last year or so and lost all four, so the time is right for them now to beat one of the major teams.
