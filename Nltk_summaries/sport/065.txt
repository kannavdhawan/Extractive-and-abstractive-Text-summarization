radcliffe will compete in london paula radcliffe will compete in the flora london marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005. the 31 year old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut, defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 april race. the bedford star returned to london 12 months later, lowering her mixed race world record of 2 17 18, which she set in chicago in october 2003, by one minute 53 secs. with wins in chicago, london and new york, only the boston marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after london. boston is definitely a race i want to do at some point, but london is very special to me, said radcliffe. radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the big city marathon grand slam.
