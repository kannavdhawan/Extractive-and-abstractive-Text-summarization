you compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should, wenger said. alberto flores, president of the spanish fa's disciplinary committee, said no one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had acted in a racist way. arsenal boss arsene wenger, who was fined 15,000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating, believes that aragones' punishment was too lenient. he shouldn't have said what he said, and how much money is enough, i don't know but it doesn't look a big punishment. the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones, but was then requested to do so by spain's anti violence commission.
