after a major win, there are extra requests, obligations and interviews, all seen through to the end with courtesy and, most importantly, good humour. every match, from first round to final, is followed by a series of press interviews in three languages english, french and swiss german. hewitt, along with andy roddick and marat safin, is sure to be prominent during 2005. but realistically, all three will be fighting for the world number two ranking. you guys are funny, i have a good time with you guys, he said, genuinely happy to talk into yet another tape recorder. hewitt, at times in houston, showed form which easily matched his grand slam winning efforts of 2001 and 2002. but he was outplayed.
