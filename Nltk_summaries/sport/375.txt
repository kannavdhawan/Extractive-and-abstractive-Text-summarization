an integral part of a sustained period of success for england, dallaglio's crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003. rival fans, meanwhile, have tended to take an alternative view, seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby. while england did not hit the heights in dallaglio's second spell as captain, losing five of their eight post world cup tests, dallaglio led by example, leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations. the only player to play every minute of england's world cup triumph in australia, dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure england's historic win, and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters. but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum, dallaglio's career hit the buffers at speed in 1999. first came the last minute defeat to wales in which dallaglio's decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam. within two years of his debut, dallaglio was offered the england captain's band, and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa. dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993. it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv, but once there he proved to the manor born.
