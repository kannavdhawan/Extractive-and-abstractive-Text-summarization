they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge, won at newcastle in the carling cup, and then won 4 1 at fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season, even when arsenal were flying at the start, and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind. as i said, winning the major honours is the hardest task of all, but in mourinho they have a manager who will make it a whole lot easier to handle the anticipation and expectation that will come their way now. mourinho has won the biggest club prize of all, the champions league, and that track record and confidence transmits itself to top players. they have got strength in depth, great players, an outstanding manager in jose mourinho and finances no other club in the world can match. mourinho had his say on that game, complaining five four is a hockey score, not a football score.
