they beat a very tough everton at stamford bridge, won at newcastle in the carling cup, and then won 4 1 at fulham, which was a great result given that they had been showing good form. i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season, even when arsenal were flying at the start, and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind.
