i have said i believed chelsea would win the league this season even when arsenal were flying at the start and i have seen nothing to make me change me mind. mourinho plots impressive course chelsea s win at fulham confirming their position at the premiership summit proves that they now have everything in place to mount serious challenges on all fronts this season. and chelsea would have taken encouragement from arsenal s rocky defensive display at spurs even though they ran out 5 4 winners. chelsea have no such problems at present which is why i would still place my money on them to edge out arsenal as champions this season. mourinho doesn t simply talk a good game he s won some very big games such as the champions league final with porto.
