coach ranieri sacked by valencia claudio ranieri has been sacked as valencia coach just eight months after taking charge at the primera liga club for the second time in his career. ranieri first took charge of valencia in 1997, guiding them to the king's cup and helping them to qualify for the champions league. we understand, and he understands, that the results in the last few weeks have not been the most appropriate, said club president juan bautista. the 54 year old then moved to atletico madrid in 1999, before joining chelsea the following year. italian ranieri took over the valencia job in june 2004 having been replaced at chelsea by jose mourinho. things began well but the spanish champions extended their winless streak to six after losing to racing santander last weekend.
