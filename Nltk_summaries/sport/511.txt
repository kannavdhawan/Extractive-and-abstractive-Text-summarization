saulnier battled to a 6 7 3 7 6 3 6 3 win over seventh seed jurgen melzer who twisted his ankle early in the second se the american top seed and defending champion overcame germany s tommy haas the third seed 7 6 7 3 6 3. i was feeling horrible earlier in the week roddick sai roddick to face saulnier in final andy roddick will play cyril saulnier in the final of the sap open in san jose on sunda but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead 4 2. it s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top five player and don t do anything with them admitted haa
