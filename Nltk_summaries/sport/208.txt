souness backs smith for scotland graeme souness believes walter smith would be the perfect choice to succeed berti vogts as scotland manager. if he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain smith's long time right hand man archie knox would also play a part in the national team set up. smith was assistant to ferguson at the world cup in mexico in 1986. the former everton and rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as manchester united assistant last term. other candidates for the job include former scotland midfielders gordon strachan and gary mcallister and vogts' assistant tommy burns. souness's former assistant at rangers is hot favourite to take over from vogts, who resigned on monday.
