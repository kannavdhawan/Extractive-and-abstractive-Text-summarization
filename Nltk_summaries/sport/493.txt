connors' rallying cry for british tennis do you have it in your heart how much guts do you have how much do you hate to lose these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain's brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come. britain has a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion, said connors. you know, everybody hits the ball well and there's a very fine line between number one and number 100, said connors. there's only one number one spot and it's lonely up there, but it's got the best view. despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain's great new hope, connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon.
