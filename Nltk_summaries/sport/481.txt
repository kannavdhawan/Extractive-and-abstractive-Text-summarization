roddick splits from coach gilbert andy roddick has ended an 18 month association with coach brad gilbert which yielded the us open title and saw the american become world number one. federer, who has not had a coach since he split from peter lundgren at the end of last year, beat roddick to win the wimbledon title and in two other tournament finals. but roddick slipped to second this year behind roger federer, who became the first man since 1988 to win three majors in a season. the decision to not re hire brad gilbert for the 2005 season is based on what i think is best for my game at this time, said roddick. roddick won 121 of his 147 matches while working with gilbert, and said he had enjoyed their time together.
