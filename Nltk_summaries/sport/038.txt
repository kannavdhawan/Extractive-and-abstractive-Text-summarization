she thought that if she won, people would say why couldn't she do that in athens and if she lost, people would say her career was over. now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year, have a well earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism. most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in paula's mind. and although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens. if paula's last experience of the year had been athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism.
