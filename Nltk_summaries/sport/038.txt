now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year have a well earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and 10 000m in athens. she thought that if she won people would say why couldn t she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over. if paula s last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. a win in the new york marathon doesn t make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year.
