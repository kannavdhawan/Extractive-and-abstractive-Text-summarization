england coach faces rap after row england coach andy robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee jonathan kaplan in his side's six nations defeat to ireland. kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in england's 19 13 defeat at landsdowne road and admitted he was very disappointed with robinson's remarks. should the rfu resolve the issue to our satisfaction, as happened last month when the scotland coach matt williams apologised for remarks made, it would be the end of the matter. after reviewing tapes of the match, the rfu decided not to formally complain to the irb over the standard of kaplan's refereeing. robinson had said he was livid about kaplan's decisions on saturday to disallow two england tries. instead the rfu said in a statement they would, set out any concerns the england team management may have in a confidential manner .
