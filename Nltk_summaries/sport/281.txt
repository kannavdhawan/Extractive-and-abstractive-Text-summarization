wenger shock at newcastle dip arsenal manager arsene wenger has admitted he is at a loss to explain why newcastle are languishing in the bottom half of the table. the gunners travel to st james' park on wednesday, with newcastle 14th in the premiership after a troubled season. striker thierry henry, along with robert pires, scored against fulham. fatigue won't play too big a part in the next few weeks as we have players coming back so i can rotate a bit more. we do not play a season with 11 players and i believe that all of our squad deserve a chance in the team. and wenger said at the beginning of the season you would expect them to be fighting for the top four.
