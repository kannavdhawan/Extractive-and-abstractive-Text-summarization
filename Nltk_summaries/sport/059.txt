european medal chances improve what have the european indoor trials told us well i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects. it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump high jump and 60m hurdles and you can t ask for more than that. in fact the men s 60m hurdles is so strong i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid. the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton s win in the 60m hurdles.
