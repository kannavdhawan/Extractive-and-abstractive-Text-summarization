the american top seed and defending champion overcame germany s tommy haas the third seed 7 6 7 3 6 3. and saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi final with seventh seeded austrian jurgen melze the frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame melzer who was left fuming over a series of line calls 6 7 3 7 6 3 6 3. i was feeling horrible earlier in the week roddick sai roddick into san jose final andy roddick will play cyril saulnier in the final of the sap open in san jose on sunda but he broke straight back and then broke haas again to lead 4 2. it s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top five player and don t do anything with them admitted haa
