arnesen denies rift with santini tottenham sporting director frank arnesen has denied that coach jacques santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at white hart lane. i think the problems go a lot deeper between the director of football at white hart lane and santini stevens told five live. arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. but frank arnesen was a very creative forward thinking and expansive player whereas i think santini was very much the opposite more a case of being organised disciplined and happy not conceding goals. tottenham s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.
