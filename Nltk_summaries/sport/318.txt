williams says he will never quit defiant matt williams says he will not quit as scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by italy at murrayfield. i have never quit anything in my life, apart from maybe painting the kitchen, he told bbc sport. we could have won in paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat italy too. williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure, despite the possibility of a second six nations series without a victory. williams has yet to experience an rbs six nations victory after seven attempts and scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership.
