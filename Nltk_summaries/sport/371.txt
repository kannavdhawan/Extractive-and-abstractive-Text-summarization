the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society, even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre match tradition of the maori war dance, the haka the other great symbol of new zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903, the kiwis triumphing 22 3 in sydney, and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. a young, talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners, but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52 3 and 54 9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he along with a generation of wales' best players chose to head north to rugby league. wilson whinneray's side rallied to beat wales 6 0, their first win at the arms park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was what happened in newport the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales, as they beat the full wales team 13 6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19 16 by the all blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james inspired lions of 1971. james guided llanelli to a famous 9 3 win over the tourists at stradey park, though, and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23 11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed 'all golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby and the long running controversy between the countries over the all blacks' inclusion of maori players.
