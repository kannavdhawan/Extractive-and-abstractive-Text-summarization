ferguson puts faith in youngsters manchester united manager sir alex ferguson said he has no regrets after his second string side lost 3 0 away at fenerbahce in the champions league. ferguson admitted his side were well beaten by the turks, a result which meant they finished second in group d behind lyon. i care about united, that's important, so while i am disappointed at the result i am not at the team i selected. we could get inter, ac milan and juventus but bayern, barcelona and real madrid were among the runners up. i didn't think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and i still don't.
