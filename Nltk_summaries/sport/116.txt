bosvelt optimistic over new deal manchester city s paul bosvelt will find out within a month whether he is to be offered a new one year deal. the 34 year old dutch midfielder is out of contract in the summer and although his age may count against him he feels he can play on for another season. bosvelt joined city from feyenoord in 2003 and at first he struggled to adapt to life in england. they promised me an answer within the next month so i am waiting to see he said. i told the club i would like to stay for one more year.
