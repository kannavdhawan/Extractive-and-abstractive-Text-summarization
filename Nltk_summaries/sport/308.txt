with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly half. he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield. tom smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of chris cusiter, jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. henson stakes early lions claim the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.
