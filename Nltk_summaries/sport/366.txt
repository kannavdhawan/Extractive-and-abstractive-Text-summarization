lomu relishing return to action former all black star jonah lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former england rugby union captain martin johnson's testimonial on 4 june. the match on 4 june will be my first 15 man game but i have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things, said lomu. at his lowest ebb lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long term target is to play for new zealand again. the 29 year old had a kidney transplant in july 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at twickenham. i used to take two steps and fall over but now i can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than i ever thought it would. i have got so much energy since my operation that i train three times a day, six days a week.
