bortolami predicts dour contest italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday s six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter. this year italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28 17. however they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh said bortolami. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000 but two of those have come against scotland. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations.
