he added i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack which is, after all, where games usually start and finish. moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales, france and ireland in this year's tournament. assertiveness in the pack isn't there, we're not getting enough people into the breakdowns, he explained. the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don't have the requisite experience, moore added. there are players who have been knocking on the door, it's time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there's nothing on them. with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson, coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance.
