swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6 3. the match was a re run of last week's final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam, where federer triumphed, but not until ljubicic had stretched him all the way. i really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and i did, and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm, federer said. but ljubicic, who beat tim henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. and with roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick, he said. i had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.
