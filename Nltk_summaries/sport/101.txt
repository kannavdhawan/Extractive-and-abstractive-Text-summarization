man city james, mills bradley wright phillips 83 , dunne, distin, thatcher, shaun wright phillips, barton macken 68 , sibierski, mcmanaman, musampa, fowler. man utd carroll, gary neville, ferdinand, brown, heinze, o'shea ronaldo 33 , keane, fortune, fletcher giggs 64 , rooney, scholes phil neville 84 . wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. derby games can be like that, they can be scrappy, dull, horrible and it was maybe like that. but we still had four good chances, two after we'd gone 2 0 down, the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from.
