kirwan demands italy consistency italy coach john kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing ireland close when they meet wales on saturday. italy's half backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum half alessandro troncon impressing but fly half luciano orquera having an off day with the boot. our goal is to match every side we face and against ireland we showed we could do that, said kirwan. despite losing 28 17 in sunday's six nations encounter, the italians confirmed their continuing improvement. orquera's kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence.
