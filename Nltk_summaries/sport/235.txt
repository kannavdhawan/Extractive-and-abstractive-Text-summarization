ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy's tackle, which earned the dutchman a ban, could have given cole a serious injury , but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors. in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself, ferguson said on saturday. the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss, in an interview with the independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october. united won 2 0 that day, at old trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson's clothes covered in soup and pizza. it's a disgrace, but i don't expect wenger to ever apologise, he's that type of person.
