at the start of the year, an o'sullivan had been earmarked as ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at the start of the year, several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august, an out of form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. but come late august, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics or to be more accurate, the lack of it. james mcilroy, gareth turnbull, zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. lombard's shattering of mark carroll's national 10,000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation.
