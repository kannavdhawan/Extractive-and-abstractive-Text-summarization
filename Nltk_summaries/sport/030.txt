at the start of the year, an o'sullivan had been earmarked as ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition.
