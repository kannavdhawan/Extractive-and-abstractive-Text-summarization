the bid chairman, lord coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an olympic middle distance runner. we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, i got back on the treadmill. when i'm at home, i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london, i was in a pressurised situation, but i found it easy to relax by running. he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children's hospices, the children with leukaemia charity, and the trust's own project which aims to provide inner city schools with rowing equipment. anyway, i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday. you'd have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives, wouldn't think it would be that bad.
