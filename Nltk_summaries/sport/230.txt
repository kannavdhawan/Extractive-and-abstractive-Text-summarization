hitzlsperger waiting on o'leary aston villa's thomas hitzlsperger is waiting to learn the future of manager david o'leary before committing himself to a new contract with the club. o'leary wants his backroom staff assistant manager roy aitken and fitness coach steve mcgregor to also be given satisfactory deals, which will tie them to villa until the summer of 2008. but he wants assurances that o'leary will also be committing himself long term because negotiations over a new three and a half year contract appear to have stalled. o'leary has been in talks over a new deal and he said i had a message from thomas' agent asking me what the news was on myself. hitzlsperger's current deal expires in the summer and he has been offered a new deal by the midlands club. the reason thomas is not speaking to the club is because the agent wants to see the outcome of what happens to me.
