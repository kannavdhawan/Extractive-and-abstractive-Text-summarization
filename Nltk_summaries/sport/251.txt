when we took over leeds united in march 2004, the club had a debt of 103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under 25m. outgoing leeds chairman gerald krasner said this deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and i believe mr bates' proposals are totally for the benefit of the club.
