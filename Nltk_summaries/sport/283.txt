when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford, that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence, said wenger. tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given. the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right, said jol after the 0 0 draw. what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it. it was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line i've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career.
