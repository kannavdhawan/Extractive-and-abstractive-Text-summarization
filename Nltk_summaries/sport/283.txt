tv calls after carroll error spurs boss martin jol said his team were robbed at manchester united after pedro mendes shot clearly crossed the line but was not given. when the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at old trafford that just reinforces what i feel there should be video evidence said wenger. it was a very nice goal it was clearly over the line i ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. it s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal. but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.
