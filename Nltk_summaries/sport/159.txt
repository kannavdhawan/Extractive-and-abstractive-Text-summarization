mourinho's side were knocked out of the fa cup by newcastle last sunday before seeing barcelona secure a 2 1 champions league first leg lead in the nou camp. mourinho defiant on chelsea form chelsea boss jose mourinho has insisted that sir alex ferguson and arsene wenger would swap places with him. we have lost one important game this week at newcastle and we're out of the fa cup but i don't think a defeat in a first leg tie is a real defeat. in the champions league all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still chelsea. they cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us, mourinho said.
