benitez deflects blame from dudek liverpool manager rafael benitez has refused to point the finger of blame at goalkeeper jerzy dudek after portsmouth claimed a draw at anfield. benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw. dudek fumbled a cross before lomana lualua headed home an injury time equaliser levelling after steven gerrard put liverpool ahead. he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot so i don t blame him for what happened. if you don t have any chances you have to think of other things but when you are creating so many chances as we are there is nothing you can say to the players.
