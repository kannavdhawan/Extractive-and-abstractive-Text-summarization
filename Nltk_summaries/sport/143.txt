wenger handed summer war chest arsenal boss arsene wenger has been guaranteed transfer funds to boost his squad the summer. the club s managing director keith edelman stressed that the development of their new 350m stadium had no affect on wenger s spending power. its great to have nice new surroundings but if the team aren t performing on the pitch then there isn t great respect in having a fabulous stadium he said. edelman added that it was pointless having a brand new stadium if the team did not match the surroundings. it s important that we had sufficient funds for our team in place before we began on the stadium.
