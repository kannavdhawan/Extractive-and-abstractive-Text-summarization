robinson said this is very disappointing for me as this means i miss england's last two games in the six nations at twickenham and two games for my club, sale sharks. among the key figures already missing are jonny wilkinson, mike tindall, will greenwood, julian white and phil vickery a list which leaves robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role.
