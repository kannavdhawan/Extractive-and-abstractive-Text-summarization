mcclaren eyes uefa cup top spot steve mcclaren wants his middlesbrough team to win their uefa cup group by beating partizan belgrade. to need a win to finish top is fantastic, but it is going to be a tough one, mcclaren said. lazio were favourites, villarreal have been semi finalists, and partizan have fantastic experience in europe. but boss mcclaren is looking for a victory which would mean they avoid a team that has played in the champions league in friday's third round draw. boro have already qualified for the knockout stages alongside partizan and villareal, at the expense of lazio.
