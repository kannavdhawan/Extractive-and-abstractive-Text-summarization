o'connell, who made a try scoring international debut against wales two years ago, is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby's shop window but refuses to be drawn on the lions. he also said he remains wary of wounded england's abilities coming into sunday's game after two straight defeats, dismissing predictions of a certain irish victory. i have spoken to sir clive woodward a few times, but not for very long, certainly nothing about summer holidays, he joked. i came on as a replacement and we were losing 13 6, and ended up getting hammered 42 6, so i know what can happen when england come to dublin. o'connell is rumoured to be among the front runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on sunday's six nations crunch clash with england. o'connell rejects lions rumours ireland and munster lock paul o'connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the lions tour to new zealand this summer.
