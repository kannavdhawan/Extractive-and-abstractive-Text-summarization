doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about. in my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i'd be able to race. at the moment, every time i go and do a big bit of movement, my whole pelvic area all down my lower back just tightens up. my back had been broken in two places and with one of my vertebrae, the bottom part had exploded so i'm fierce lucky not be paralysed. all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. it's all about trying to get mobility in my back. jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back.
