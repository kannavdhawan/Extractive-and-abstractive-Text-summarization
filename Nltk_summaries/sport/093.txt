doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie's back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about. in my back, it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i'd be able to race.
