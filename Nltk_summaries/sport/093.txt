doctors in athens had wanted to operate on jamie s back immediately but he insisted on delaying any surgery until he arrived back home something he is now very relieved about. jamie had to wear a body cast for three and a half months after the accident and spent most of that time flat on his back. in my back it felt as though all the muscles had been ripped off my pelvis but i was thinking maybe we could do something with laser therapy and ultra sound and hopefully i d be able to race. all these sessions are small steps on the way to what jamie hopes will be a return to racing in 2006. it s all about trying to get mobility in my back. jamie has also travelled to receive treatment at the polish training centre in spala where he has trained with triple olympic champion robert korzeniowski over the past five years.
