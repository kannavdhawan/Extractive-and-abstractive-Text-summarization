williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby. there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case. but williams said i want to make it clear that i m committed totally to scottish rugby. we on the other hand will have 16. there must be a win win philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing. the idea that we are lighting cigars with 20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue.
