that was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end to end with lots of good passing, said the old trafford boss. ferguson hails man utd's resolve manchester united's alex ferguson has praised his players' gutsy performance in the 1 0 win at aston villa. ferguson also hailed senior stars ryan giggs and roy keane, who came off the bench for the injured john o'shea. i look at that fixture and think we've been there and won, while arsenal and chelsea have yet to come and villa may have some players back when they do. roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. all we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we'll get our rewards.
