el guerrouj targets cross country double olympic champion hicham el guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the world cross country championships in france. i haven't quite decided what events i will compete in prior to london but the world cross country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility, said the two time champion. el guerrouj could meet bekele in march as the ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. but the moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 march. if i am to compete in it, it is only if i feel i can win, said the 30 year old, who is retiring in 2006. otherwise there is not much point in me going.
