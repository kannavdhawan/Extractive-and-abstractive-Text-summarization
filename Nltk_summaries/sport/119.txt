often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. i would say it's 50 50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. time to get tough on friendlies for an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. it would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. and it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth.
