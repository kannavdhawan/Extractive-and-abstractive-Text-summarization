rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men s tennis for not releasing contamination free supplements in time for the new season. the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond. this event comes in the hottest period of the year so you would hope the stuff would be available for it. in response the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination free drinks and nutritional bars for the men s tour.
