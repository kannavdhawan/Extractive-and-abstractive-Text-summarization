rusedski angry over supplements greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination free supplements in time for the new season. and rusedski, who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday, conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial. the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee, so hopefully all this will never happen again, said rusedski. in response, the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination free drinks and nutritional bars for the men's tour. this event comes in the hottest period of the year, so you would hope the stuff would be available for it. david higdon, vice president of the atp, admitted i agree with greg.
