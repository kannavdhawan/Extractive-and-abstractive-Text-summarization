liverpool pledge to keep gerrard liverpool chief executive rick parry insists the club will never sell steven gerrard amid reports chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from anfield. but if we want to win more games, important games, we need steven in the team. i know i put a lot of pressure on myself because of what i said, and i felt i needed a big performance, but i am not going to go around telling lies about how i feel. gerrard had said before wednesday's game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of europe, with real madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation. the main point i have made is i want to be in a liverpool side which challenges for the champions league and the title all the time, he said afterwards. gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give liverpool a 3 1 win over olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages.
