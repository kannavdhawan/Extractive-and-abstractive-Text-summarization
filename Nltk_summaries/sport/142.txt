recent speculation has linked owen with a move back to england, with newcastle expressing their interest, but the england striker said he is not ready to return home. he added i've got nothing against the premiership, i mean that's where i first performed, that's where i made my name. but the 25 year old, who has spent much of his time coming off the bench in la liga, did not rule out a return to the premiership at some stage. owen, who moved to the bernabeu from liverpool last summer, has grabbed 11 goals for real but has been unable to replace raul or ronaldo in the starting line up. owen determined to stay in madrid england forward michael owen has told the bbc he is happy in spain and has no plans to quit real madrid to return to the premiership in the near future. but as much as our press like to build it up as if i've permanently had my backside on the bench, i've played as many games as anyone else in the team this year.
