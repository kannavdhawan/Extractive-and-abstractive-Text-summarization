pearce keen on succeeding keegan joint assistant boss stuart pearce has admitted he would like to succeed kevin keegan as manager at manchester city. you don't have to be einstein to realise there will be a manager's job available at a really good club, pearce told bbc gmr. he was linked with the manager's job at oldham and keegan has stated he would not get in the way if pearce wanted to leave. pearce initially joined city as a player under keegan in 2001 before becoming part of the coaching staff. he added by that time, i will have been here for five years so at least they will have had a good look at me and they are aware of my feelings with regard to being kevin's successor. i will certainly be applying for it, although whether the board deem me good enough to take it, i do not know.
