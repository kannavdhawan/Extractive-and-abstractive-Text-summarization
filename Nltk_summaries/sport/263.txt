mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday. mcleish told bbc radio five live we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it we absolutely blew it. the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. mcleish admitted his team s defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2 0 to guy roux s french side. there s no use burying your head in the sand we know we are going to get a lot of criticism.
