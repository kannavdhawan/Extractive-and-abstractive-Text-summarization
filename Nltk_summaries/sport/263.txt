mcleish ready for criticism rangers manager alex mcleish accepts he is going to be criticised after their disastrous uefa cup exit at the hands of auxerre at ibrox on wednesday. mcleish admitted his team's defending was amateurish after watching them lose 2 0 to guy roux's french side. mcleish told bbc radio five live we were in pole position to get through to the next stage but we blew it, we absolutely blew it. there's no use burying your head in the sand, we know we are going to get a lot of criticism. the early goal in the second half gave us a mountain to climb and we never created the same kind of chances as we did in the first half. i'm very disappointed because we didn't give ourselves a chance, losing the first goal from our own corner.
