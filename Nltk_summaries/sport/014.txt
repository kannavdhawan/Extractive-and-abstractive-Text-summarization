mcilroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for ireland at the outdoor european championships in 1998. that was my last decent year, said mcilroy, who temporarily retired last august before returning to the sport under lester's shrewd guidance. i believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in sheffield, i can run my race from the front, back or middle, said mcilroy.
