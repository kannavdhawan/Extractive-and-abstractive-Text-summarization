it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half. so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball. that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half. every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon.
