. in the backs, we were not frustrated at such, but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical. it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee. their organisation was very, very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by. i'm not too bad, but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning.
