wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france, having secured back to back wins under graham henry in 1999 and 2001. and with the likes of shane williams and gavin henson finding top form at the right time, mike ruddock's team is now one of international rugby's most potent attacking threats. gethin jenkins won't be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will, said jones, who will be facing france for the first time. the lock believes the welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line out, but jones insisted his fellow front row colleagues have nothing to fear. prop jones ready for hard graft adam jones says the wales forwards are determined to set the perfect attacking platform for the backs by dominating the powerful france pack in paris. the mentality of the french is 'scrum, scrum, scrum'. he has been bouncing around the place this week, so he is up for it, warned jones.
