athens memories soar above lows well it s goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed and that s where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. and if even the smallest thing doesn t feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. i thought why wouldn t you do the 800m it s your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.
