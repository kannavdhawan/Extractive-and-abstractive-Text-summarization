as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real bouncebackability . athens memories soar above lows well, it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens. i think the four of them jason gardener, darren campbell, marlon devonish and mark lewis francis knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal.
