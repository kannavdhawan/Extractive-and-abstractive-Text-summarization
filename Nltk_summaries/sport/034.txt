as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.
