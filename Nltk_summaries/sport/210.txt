tevez an argentine in brazil some 65 years ago bernardo gandulla left boca juniors in his native argentina and headed for brazil. like so many of the top south american players tevez has the gift of being able to surprise to feint right and go left to pass when he was expected to dribble to shoot and catch the goalkeeper unawares. it is particularly strange as until last week tevez was not even an especially big name in brazil where the argentine championship is not shown. the new maradona carlos tevez is joining corinthians for nearly 20m in a strong candidate for the strangest move of the year. that passion can also be turned against the team especially nowadays when the level of urban violence gives a hysterical edge to life in brazil s big cities.
