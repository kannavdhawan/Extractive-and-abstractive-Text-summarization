cole refuses to blame van persie ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fully fit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united. freddie ljungberg is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either arturo lupoli, quincy owusu abeyie or jeremie aliadiere. thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said no one is putting the blame on robin. arsenal are also without winger robert pires, who sustained an ankle injury at st mary's. i've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds.
