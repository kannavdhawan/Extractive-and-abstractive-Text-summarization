there is a chance for us now to go on, win our home games and why not win the group, even though it's a tough one, said the liverpool player. switzerland, ireland, france and israel are all now tied on five points from three matches although the republic look to have a slight edge after claiming away draws in basel and paris. looking back, we had an opportunity to get the three points, but we are happy with a point and that will give us confidence going into wednesday's game. the versatile finnan, who starred against the french, is confident the group is ireland's for the taking. as i play on the right for my club and being a natural right back, it was something he kerr looked at because france play strongly down the left hand side. it would certainly be good to avoid a play off, but on the back of a couple of good results i don't see why we can't win the group.
