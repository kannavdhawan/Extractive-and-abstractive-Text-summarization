robben sidelined with broken foot chelsea winger arjen robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks. six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then i need a few more weeks to be completely fit again he told dutch newspaper algemeen dagblad. robben who has been a key part of the blues push for four trophies claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by blackburn midfielder aaron mokoena. but this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last world cup and which has kept scott parker out for two months. the 21 year old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with roma s olivier dacourt.
