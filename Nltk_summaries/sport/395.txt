similarly, wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision making under pressure are equally important. welsh legend mervyn davies, a member of two of three grand slam winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades . that they recovered from a battering in the first half hour to first stem the tide before half time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. a crestfallen france coach, bernard laporte, simply observed there was a french half and there was a welsh half . martyn williams, wales' two try scorer on the day, called it one of the most surreal games i have ever played in . paris promise raises welsh hopes has there been a better six nations match than saturday's epic in paris and can the welsh revival continue all the way to a first grand slam since 1978 those are the two questions occupying not just wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in paris.
