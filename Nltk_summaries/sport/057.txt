but should we be surprised if the olympic champion over both those distances decides she just does not feel like racing anymore well, it's a lot easier being the double olympic champion, being feted by everybody, than training to be at the top in middle distance running, points out former olympian and bbc pundit steve cram. so, why is holmes dragging her heels about making a decision on where, when or whether to even bother competing again that's just kelly, explains cram. four months later, holmes stormed to double olympic gold and has since been made a dame, won the bbc sport personality of the year and written a book whilst still finding time to coach aspiring athletes. what now for kelly holmes last april, kelly holmes spoke to the bbc sport website about her loneliness, her fight to stay fit and her decision not to contest both the 800m and 1500m at the olympics. us 400m and 200m legend michael johnson, a five time olympic gold medallist, retired shortly after his 34th birthday as did britain's double olympic champion decathlete daley thompson. on the other hand, if those achievements cannot be matched shouldn't they be at least shared and celebrated you don't get the chance very often in your career to step onto the track as the double olympic champion, agreed cram.
