holmes secures comeback victory britain s kelly holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double olympic gold with 1500m victory at the norwich union international. holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell out crowd in glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds. but the 34 year old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the birmingham grand prix on 18 february. the reception i ve had since the olympics has been amazing and that s why i wanted to keep running this year because i get a buzz from the crowd. holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of france s hind dehiba and russia s svetlana cherkasova.
