i'm wouldn't say i'm bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it's harry's life and it's his decision. southampton chairman rupert lowe was desperate to give former academy director wigley, who replaced paul sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at st mary's. i said to harry 'i hope you don't go to southampton', and he told me 'absolutely not', he said. redknapp, 57, quit his fratton park position on 24 november and vowed i will not go down the road no chance. it would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time, mandaric said on portsmouth's official website.
