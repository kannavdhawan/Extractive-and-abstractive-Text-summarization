white prepared for battle tough scrummaging prop julian white is expecting a resurgent wales to give him a rough ride in england s six nations opener in cardiff on saturday. the 31 year old has made a massive contribution to the england and leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight head prop in the world. i don t know how much experience a tight head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way he added. leicester who signed white from bristol when the west country side were relegated from the zurich premiership in the summer of 2003 have also been aided by white s presence this season. white missed the vast majority of last year s six nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going.
