dallaglio eyeing lions tour place former england captain lawrence dallaglio still harbours hopes of a place on the british and irish lions tour to new zealand. from what i witnessed at close quarters on sunday in our heineken cup match against leicester, i certainly didn't feel out of place alongside those players, many of whom will be on the trip. but dallaglio, who called time on england earlier this year, said i assure you i wouldn't let anyone down. lions coach sir clive woodward has made it clear he will pick his squad to tour next summer based on form shown in the six nations championship. dallaglio toured south africa with the lions in 1997 but was forced home early with a knee injury from the trip to australia three years ago.
