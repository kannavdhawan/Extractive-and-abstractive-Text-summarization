five metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick stephen jones, who had seen a long range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence. he also had a hand in the game's only try, finished superbly by williams, and might have scored himself on the half hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by tait. showing awesome strength, henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill. henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero. and his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, mathew tait. the england centre will have spent his 19th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up ended not just once, but twice, by henson's all enveloping tackles.
