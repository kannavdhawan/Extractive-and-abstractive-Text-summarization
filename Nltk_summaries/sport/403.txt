and they won only two games, against scotland and italy, in 2004. wales' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards, phil bennett, jpr williams et al. but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win, and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri, but is lacking in raw materials. the fresh verve is inspired by skipper gareth thomas, now out with a broken thumb, accurate kicking from either fly half stephen jones or centre gavin henson, a rampant martyn williams leading the way up front, and exciting runners in the guise of henson and shane williams. no one knows what mood france will be in at lansdowne road on 12 march sublime, as in the first half against wales, or ridiculous, like in the same period against england at twickenham. england are enduring their worst run in the championship since captain richard hill was dumped in favour of mike harrison after three straight losses in 1987. coach andy robinson, who took over from the successful sir clive woodward in september, has lost a phalanx of world cup stars.
