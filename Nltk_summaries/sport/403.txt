and they won only two games, against scotland and italy, in 2004. wales' most recent championship title was in 1994, and their last grand slam success came in 1978 in the era of gareth edwards, phil bennett, jpr williams et al. but they have not won the title since 1985 and last clinched a grand slam in 1948. as for scotland, they have struggled this decade and the 2004 wooden spoon winners have not been in the top two since they lifted the title in 1999. italy continue the elusive search for their first six nations away win, and can still only account for the scalps of scotland twice and wales since joining the elite in 2000. coach john kirwan is a passionate and dedicated believer in the azzurri, but is lacking in raw materials.
