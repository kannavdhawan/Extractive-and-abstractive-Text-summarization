the 36 year old, who has 54 caps, was llanelli's player of the season in 2001 2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at stradey. we have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won't all be re signed, it's a chance to invigorate the squad, he said. realising i would be unable to play this season, the club and i agreed to end my contract early, said hodges. the scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing heineken cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks. gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back five forward hodges has played at stradey park, though.
