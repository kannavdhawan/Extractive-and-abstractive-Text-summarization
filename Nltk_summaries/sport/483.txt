hewitt survives nalbandian epic home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi finals. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6 3 6 2 1 6 3 6 10 8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets. it was always tough serving second in the fifth set, said hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat.
