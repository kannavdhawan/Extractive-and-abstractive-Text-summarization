ferguson urges henry punishment sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal s thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze. there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal seven on heinze five on ronaldo six by vieira and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united s controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy s foul on ashley cole for which he got a three game ban. the clash occurred moments before half time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline.
