jones was happy to hail henson's heroic contribution to wales' first win over england in cardiff since 1993. physically he's a specimen he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well, jones said. jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales, 9 8 down, were awarded a long range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff.
