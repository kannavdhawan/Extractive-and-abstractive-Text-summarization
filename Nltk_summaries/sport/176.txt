he is still a quality player and knows where the net is we have just got to supply him with ammunition and, in the end, we did, keegan said. the 29 year old, out of favour at city earlier this season, took his premiership goal tally past 150 with a brace in monday's 3 2 win at norwich. the former liverpool striker, who moved to city in 2003 after a poor stint at leeds, has battled back into first team contention after struggling with fitness at the start of the season. fowler overtook les ferdinand on tuesday evening to become the third highest scorer of all time in the premiership, with 151 goals, and he only trails alan shearer 250 and andy cole 173 . fowler's double strike helped city come back from two goals down to clinch a dramatic win at carrow road and keegan sympathised with norwich boss nigel worthington afterwards.
