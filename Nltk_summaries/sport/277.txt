celtic unhappy over bulgaria date martin o'neill hopes to block stilian petrov's call up by bulgaria during celtic's busy festive programme. when we were out playing barcelona, i spoke with the bulgarian manager, hristo stoichkov, and he mentioned this game to me. we pay his wages, we are the ones that if an awkward fixture is going to be played at some stage or another it should be to our benefit, rather than anyone else. bulgaria's game comes between celtic's boxing day meeting with hearts and their 2 january fixture against livingston. i can't say i was overly pleased at the fixture being played just after christmas, said o'neill.
