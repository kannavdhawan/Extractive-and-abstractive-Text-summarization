andrew ryder, of the traveller law reform coalition, said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers, so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. in their november report, mps from the committee scrutinising the office for the deputy prime minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop. many mps with rural constituencies, particularly in eastern england, have been pressing the government to create stronger enforcement powers, saying villagers are suffering because of the legal delays in removing illegal encampments. that scheme has paid out 25m in four years, with 8m available for 2005. there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites, said ms cooper. councils 'must find gypsy sites' ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers, amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments.
