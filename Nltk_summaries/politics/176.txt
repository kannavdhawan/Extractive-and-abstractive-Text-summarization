councils must find gypsy sites ministers are telling councils to find more sites for travellers amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments. that is why we are consulting on a new obligation on local authorities to identify more appropriate sites as well as new powers to take immediate action if the development is in the wrong place and cannot be tolerated in even the short term because of risk to local amenity and the environment. andrew ryder of the traveller law reform coalition said we welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for gypsies and travellers so long as it is a real obligation as opposed to a recommendation which could be and was easily ignored. that scheme has paid out 25m in four years with 8m available for 2005. there are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning gypsy and traveller sites said ms cooper. ms cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places.
