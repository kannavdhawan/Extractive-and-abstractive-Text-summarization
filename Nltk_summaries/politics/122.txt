and dr john moore gillon, of the british lung foundation, said tb is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the uk born population as well. the proposals, which would be brought in if the conservatives won the general election, would not apply to people coming to the uk for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. in fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their eu status, she said. meanwhile mark oaten, liberal democrat home affairs spokesman, said this is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between labour and the conservatives. immigration minister des browne quoted its five year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying we are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for tb in high risk areas at the entry clearance stage. the tests will include a health check, chest x rays for tb except for children and pregnant women and tests for hepatitis and hiv for over 16 year olds.
