but from tuesday all non eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'. it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry, for example, in holland, germany or france.
