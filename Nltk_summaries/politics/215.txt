but from tuesday all non eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'. it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry, for example, in holland, germany or france. certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married, mr rimmer said. mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. when the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister des browne said our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse.
