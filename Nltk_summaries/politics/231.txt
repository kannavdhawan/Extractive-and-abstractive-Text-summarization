at the time lord woolf, the lord chief justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald qc, who sits on the sgc, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co operation, he said. but director of the victims of crime trust, norman brennan, accused lord woolf of having an arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law abiding public . it represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity, he said.
