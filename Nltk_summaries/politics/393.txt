there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament, including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which, for example authorise the building of railways and roads, contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them. the archives do, of course, hold records of high and low politics too for both houses of parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk.
