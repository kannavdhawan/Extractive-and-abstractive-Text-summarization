there are details of foreign nationals made british citizens by act of parliament, including composer george frideric handel in 1727. and the mass of private bills which, for example authorise the building of railways and roads, contain both the names and addresses of those involved and testimonies giving people a unique perspective on how their ancestors opposed them. the archives do, of course, hold records of high and low politics too for both houses of parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in norfolk. records for the commons only date back to 1834 anything earlier was wiped out by the fire which destroyed most of the parliament buildings in 1834. but that still leaves some of the most important documents of uk political history parts of the bill of rights from 1689, the death warrant for charles i, the private papers and diaries of major politicians such as david lloyd george and andrew bonar law. the archive profession may look fairly staid but is in an enormous period of change, mainly motivated by the potential of it, which is opening up all sorts of vistas for us, he says. the legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in parliament's victoria tower.
