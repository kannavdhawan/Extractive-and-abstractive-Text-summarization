then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw, aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott without mentioning the other. so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown's long arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed should be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission often seen as the prime minister's turf has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. it dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.
