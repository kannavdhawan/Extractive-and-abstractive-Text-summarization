'fido' to be taken off vote lists the risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the uk elections watchdog has said. currently, british voters have to re register to vote every year or face being removed from the electoral rolls if they fail to do so two years running. the proposed scheme would mean voters using individual identifiers when they vote such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature. mr younger said using the royal mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters. chairman sam younger told mps on tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process which happened when northern ireland switched to a similar system.
