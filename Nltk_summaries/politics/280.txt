echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice, the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in 2001. mr blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with mr bush. blair sees greater bush consensus george w bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as us president, tony blair has said. it is significant, in my view, that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit, said mr blair. we never answer questions about special forces, but do not take that as indicating an affirmative, said mr blair. turning to critics' fears that the us was poised for further military action, mr blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against iran. following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets, mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country.
