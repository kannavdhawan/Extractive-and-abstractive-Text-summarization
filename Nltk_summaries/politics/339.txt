the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs. the party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government. mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour's promise to spend 42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010. however, as usual, the lib dems' proposals are completely uncosted, he said. mr kennedy said mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford.
