peter nielson, who is ukip scotland chairman, said he had suspended mr houston on friday night. mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy, which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. but he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the british empire, were sent to two scottish newspapers. john houston, 54, was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election.
