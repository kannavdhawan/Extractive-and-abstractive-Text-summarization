announcing the plans, mr redwood said mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries. cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police. the conservatives are committed to cutting labour's public spending plans by a massive 35 billion, he said.
