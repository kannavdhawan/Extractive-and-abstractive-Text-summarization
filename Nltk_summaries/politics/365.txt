mark serwotka, the leader of the public and commercial services union said in last year's budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the tories. at the department for work and pensions, 30,000 jobs are to go, 560 will be lost by the end of the month at the department of trade and industry and 400 are to go at the inland revenue and customs. in his budget statement, the chancellor said the first 12,500 civil service jobs had been cut, on target. he plans to axe 104,000 jobs to free up money for education, health, defence, housing and overseas aid. about 4,300 civil servants will leave london and the south east by the end of march 2005 and there are plans to relocate another 3,500. of those 300 department of health posts will go to yorkshire while hundreds at the department of culture will move to birmingham and newcastle. there was a time when the only worry thousands of hard working civil and public servants had on budget day was whether petrol or taxes would go up, nowadays the worry is whether they will have a job by the end of it.
