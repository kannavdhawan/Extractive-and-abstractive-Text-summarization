on thursday, lord bingham a senior law lord said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not britons. but liberal democrat peer lord carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. in a statement, detainee 'a' in woodhill prison said i hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones. solicitor gareth pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to madness , saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital. lord nicholls of birkenhead, in his ruling, said indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary, he told bbc radio 4's today programme.
