the councils' umbrella organisation cosla, which provided bbc scotland with the indicative figures for next year, warned that councils would face a continuous struggle to maintain services. councils prepare to set tax rises council tax in scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, bbc scotland has learned. however, most of the increase is targeted to new initiatives and councils will experience difficulties in maintaining core services, a cosla spokesman said. he told bbc radio scotland's sunday live programme here in scotland we have 32 councils who all have their own individual collection systems for council tax, they have their own payroll systems and their own human resource systems. scottish finance minister, tom mccabe msp, said last week in parliament i announced an additional 419m for core expenditure to local government in scotland. that's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so i think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.
