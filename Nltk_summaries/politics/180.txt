falconer rebuts 'charade' claims concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia through the back door were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said. former conservative leader iain duncan smith, one of the chief critics of the plans, condemned the debate as a charade and complained the promises of changes to the bill were vague. on tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 labour mps. it is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen, he said. he told bbc news we have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life. it was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through parliament but the result was a sensible solution , he said.
