the group which represents university vice chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in kensington and chelsea, 65% in the city of london and westminster and 62% in sheffield hallam, down to 10% in bristol south and leeds central and 8% in nottingham north and sheffield brightside. the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. but the percentage of poorer students hardly changed at all , said its chief executive, sir howard newby.
