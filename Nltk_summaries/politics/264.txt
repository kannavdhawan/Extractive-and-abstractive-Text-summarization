an unremittingly new labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them. and, for some, that means showing that new labour actually does stand for something that it is, as he said, more than an electoral device . his was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what new labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach. to that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle england voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it, possibly through some gritted teeth, in 2001, and to more traditional lower income old labour supporters. with an election looming the next big speech from gordon brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.
