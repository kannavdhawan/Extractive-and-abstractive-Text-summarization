father of two mr mousa, 28, a hotel receptionist, was arrested with eight men seized at a hotel in basra in september 2003. he was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the queen's lancashire regiment. but former british commander colonel bob stewart said anyone at the top of the military will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say 'if there's a case to answer, let's have it out. after the ruling carla ferstman, legal director of the human rights organisation redress, said it is not enough for the military to investigate behind closed doors. they said as mr mousa was in custody when he died, his case came within the uk's jurisdiction. but lord justice rix and mr justice forbes ruled that uk jurisdiction could extend to a uk run prison, but did not apply to the total territory of another state .
