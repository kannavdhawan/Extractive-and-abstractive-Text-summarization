the other protesters are john holliday, 37, a huntsman from ledbury, herefordshire, robert thame, 34, who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove, auctioneer andrew elliot, 42, from bromesberrow, near ledbury, point to point jockey richard wakeham, 34, from york, and former royal chef nick wood, 41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge pro hunting demonstration in parliament square. one of the men, david redvers, 34, from hartpury, gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges. those charged included otis ferry, the 22 year old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes william and harry. however, many pro hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. otis ferry, a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt, said i have no regrets. the men's solicitor matthew knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.
