howard denies split over id cards michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards. mr howard said the police had said id cards could help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives . tory ex minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a regressive step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would set out the position very clearly when he stands up to debate the matter next week.
