the 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of china's crackdown on protesters in tiananmen square in 1989. uk foreign secretary jack straw, who will hold talks in beijing on thursday, said an eu arms code was more effective than the current ban. the code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre condition of lifting the embargo with china, he said. in the uk, more export licences were refused under the existing european union arms code than under the embargo, he said. brad adams, from human rights watch, said this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square. mr ancram argued what the british government is doing is giving in to french and german pressure, especially the french, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted.
