we all know that under age drinking is an issue in scotland but it is quite staggering that any politician, particularly the first minister, should encourage young people to get drunk. mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under age drinking, began his response with the quip i'm sure there's no under age drinking in the highlands. it was just a recognition that people will get drunk, but that binge drinking and drinks promotions that encourage it are not acceptable. he said i hope i'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them.
