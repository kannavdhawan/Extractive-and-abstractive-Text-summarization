blair sets date for africa report the commission for africa's report will be released on 11 march comic relief day, tony blair has said. bob geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for africa. as well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in africa. mr blair told a news conference it will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but i hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. july's g8 summit in gleneagles in perthshire chaired by the prime minister will use the report as the basis for talks on africa. the people involved include two african government leaders and a range of other african politicians, as well as experts from some other developed countries.
