blair moves to woo jewish voters tony blair has pledged to never ever ever attack tory leader michael howard over his jewish beliefs. during his interview with the jewish chronicle mr blair said i ve been a very strong supporter of the jewish community and israel and will always be so. mr livingstone should have withdrawn the comment immediately once he realised the journalist was jewish said mr blair. mr blair also distanced himself from recent labour campaign posters featuring mr howard which critics claimed were anti semitic . pressed on whether he would draw attention to mr howard s jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract muslim support he replied the idea that i would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous.
