blair moves to woo jewish voters tony blair has pledged to never, ever, ever attack tory leader michael howard over his jewish beliefs. during his interview with the jewish chronicle, mr blair said i've been a very strong supporter of the jewish community and israel, and will always be so. one poster depicted mr howard and his shadow chancellor oliver letwin, who is also jewish, as flying pigs. pressed on whether he would draw attention to mr howard's jewish beliefs in an attempt to attract muslim support, he replied the idea that i would allow anybody to make such a charge is outrageous. mr livingstone should have withdrawn the comment immediately once he realised the journalist was jewish, said mr blair.
