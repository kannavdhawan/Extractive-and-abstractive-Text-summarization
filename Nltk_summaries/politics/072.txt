mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes but labour s majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. but mr clarke told bbc radio 4 s today programme he believed the changes he had made to the bill to win over critics in the commons should be sufficient to satisfy colleagues in the lords. mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order amounting to house arrest would be imposed by judges and not politicians. no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords he said. speaking after the commons debate shadow home secretary david davies said the bill had been clearly very badly drawn up and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly.
