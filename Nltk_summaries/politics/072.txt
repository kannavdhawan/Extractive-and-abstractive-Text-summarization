mr clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians. no bill goes through parliament without detailed consideration being made, but i believe that what i announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the house of lords, he said. mps voted in favour of the prevention of terrorism bill after mr clarke agreed to key changes but labour's majority was reduced to 14. the bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals. the bill proposes control orders , which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. he said they need to rethink the bill, and extend the power of a judge to decide on all control orders, build safeguards on evidence and create charges against suspects. mark oaten, for the liberal democrats, said monday night's vote showed the government had lost the confidence of all sides of the house .
