pakistani women 'must not hide' hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam, president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain. mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir. but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism . and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems, so therefore we can never address it in its totality, he said. in respect of iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.
