mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them. a spokesman for the information commissioner's office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service tps lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future.
