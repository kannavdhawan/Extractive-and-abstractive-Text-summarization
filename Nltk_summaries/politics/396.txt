for example, we could send the target conservative people a letter from someone who had defected from the tories to labour explaining the reasons why voting tory is a bad idea or we could send labour weak people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote. as the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if they are asking them which way they are going to vote, they are not in breach of the law. if the appeal fails and it continues breaking the rules, it could be fined up to 5,000. labour says it avoids those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making voter identification calls. asked about the commissioner's inquiry, a labour spokesman told bbc news we expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously. the voters are put in 24 categories according to their last known voting intention, ranging from labour firm to target conservative those who supported the party in the past but this time will be voting tory.
