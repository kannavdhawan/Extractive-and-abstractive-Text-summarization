in written evidence to the committee, lord woolf said i have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue . lord woolf, who is lord chief justice of england and wales, was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries. as lord woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice. in addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government. their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence a very narrow dispute, in lord woolf's words, she said.
