the party's four new designs, launched on tuesday, steer clear of the fagin or flying pig images, but make clear that labour is sticking to its strategy of targeting the tory leader personally, with reminders of his record in office. the fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off labour's website on monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin holding a blackboard reading 2 2 5. a labour spokesman later said their removal from the party's website was not affected by the row.
