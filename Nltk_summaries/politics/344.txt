of that, 23 billion would go on spending plans, with 8 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by gordon brown, and the rest going in tax cuts. not only would his government stick to labour spending plans on core public services, including health and education, it would increase spending on defence, police and pensions. at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less, he said. ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the tory party are urging mr howard to announce something more eye catching before the election. the extension of that, however, was that labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the tories were the cutters. labour, needless to say, claim his planned 35bn efficiency savings simply don't add up and that those sorts of figures are fantasy.
