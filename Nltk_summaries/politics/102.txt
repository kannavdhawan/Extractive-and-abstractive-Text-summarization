the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast tracking of a visa application for mr blunkett's ex lover's nanny. on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average. but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance. he's been a tremendous colleague, he's done a great job for us, first as home secretary then as education secretary. at the end of his middle east trip, mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact. in his first comments since sir alan's announcement, mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail.
