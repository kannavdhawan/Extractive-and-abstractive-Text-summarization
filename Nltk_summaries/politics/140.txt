uk helps raped rwandan women britain is to give a 4m grant to help women survivors of the rwandan genocide who were raped and often deliberately infected with hiv aids. it was overshadowed by rwanda s emergence from the 100 days of slaughter during which time the mass killings took place and the women s fate was largely a taboo subject. mary kayitesi blewitt founder of the survivors fund surf one of the organisations through which the funds are being channelled said it was a recognition before it was too late that the survivors should be a priority for help. this funding is intended to make anti retrovirals and other care available for some 2 500 women. the five year department for international development funding will enable more survivors to have access to anti retroviral treatment.
