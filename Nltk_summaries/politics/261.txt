it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming labour has met all of its promises. and, more specifically, to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn. there was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only mr prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself. but it was the former health secretary's final gesture, placing an arm on mr brown's back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling. the chancellor walked side by side with mr milburn, pointedly exchanging chit chat, as they approached the microphone. if press reports are to be believed, alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of labour's next election manifesto.
