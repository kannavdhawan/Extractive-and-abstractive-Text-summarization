in bethnal green, former labour mp george galloway, who founded the anti war party respect, is standing against sitting mp oona king, who had a 10,000 vote majority in 2001. in rochdale, the liberal democrats the mainstream party a 2004 icm survey showed was benefiting most from muslim disaffection with labour secured second place in the 2001 election, securing just under 6,000 votes fewer than labour's lorna fitzsimons. this meeting is not anti party in particular, it's anti policy, it's on the issues we are going to ask muslims to vote on, mab spokesman dr azzam tamimi said of tuesday's event. dr tamimi said the main issues muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on iraq, the palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for muslims in the uk and economic, social and education problems. the constituencies where labour was most at risk from a muslim tactical vote were bethnal green, in east london, and rochdale in lancashire, he added. however, professor john curtice, of the university of strathclyde, is sceptical about how much difference tactical voting by muslims could make. for the most part the labour constituencies where there's a large muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe, professor curtice said.
