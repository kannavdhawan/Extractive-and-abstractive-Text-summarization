on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, tory mp michael mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry, told the bbc that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule. he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman, two of his own officials, three foreign office officials, a qc, christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor, lord irvine of lairg. in a statement, lord goldsmith said i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer. as i have always made clear, i set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing un security council resolutions, he said. earlier, tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his parliamentary statement had been a fair summary of his opinion.
