my concern is that, whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right wing political parties, picking up on statements like burden to britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . but, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time. the tories are already committed to imposing annual limits on immigration, with a quota for asylum seekers and with applications processed outside the uk. now home secretary charles clarke has come up with alternative proposals for a points system to ensure only immigrants who can benefit the economy will be granted entry, and to kick out more failed asylum seekers.
