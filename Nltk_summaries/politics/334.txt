immigration to be election issue immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time. my concern is that whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate right wing political parties picking up on statements like burden to britain will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . but while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before. it is precisely that concern and the possible suggestion the issue is playing to the far right s racist agenda that will provoke strong reactions from many concerned with this issue. former union leader sir bill morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers .
