my concern is that, whilst the labour party and the conservative party will take a constructive approach to the debate, right wing political parties, picking up on statements like burden to britain' will exploit this and create a lot of fear and uncertainty . but, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before.
