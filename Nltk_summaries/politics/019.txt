mr macdonell said i think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. mr macdonell political editor of the scotsman said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark they were bound to come back and bite him . the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland s binge drinking problems mr law said. he added here mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.
