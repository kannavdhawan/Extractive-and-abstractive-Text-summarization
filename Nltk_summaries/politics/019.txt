mr macdonell, political editor of the scotsman, said i think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill advised remark by the first minister. jack law, chief executive of alcohol focus scotland, said jack mcconnell's comment was ill advised . mr law, from voluntary body alcohol focus scotland, believed damage had been done to scotland's fight against binge drinking. the media attention had helped to move the focus from scotland's binge drinking problems, mr law said. mr macdonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were off the mark , they were bound to come back and bite him . he added here, mr mcconnell was talking in the highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the scottish executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.
