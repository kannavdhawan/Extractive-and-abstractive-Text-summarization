lib dem leader charles kennedy accelerating lib dem election preparations this week as he visits manchester, liverpool, leicester, somerset, basingstoke, shrewsbury, dorset and torbay. mr blair's was asked last wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration. labour accused of broken pledge labour has already broken its pre election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the tories have claimed. the prime minister told mps the abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration where families have an automatic right to settle , the numbers will probably fall. the labour party election pledges, even when they are so incredibly vague, do not even last four days. that's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country, he said.
