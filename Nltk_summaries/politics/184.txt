mr mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry into pre war intelligence, told the bbc on friday that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule. in a book published this week, philippe sands qc, a member of cherie blair's matrix chambers, says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. my view is we need the house of lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened, she said. earlier, conservative mp michael mates joined calls for a probe into claims lord goldsmith's statement to parliament was drawn up at number 10. mr blair said the statement was a fair summary of lord goldsmith's opinion. this is argument was rejected by mr blair, who said firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly peter goldsmith has made his statement and i have got absolutely nothing to add to it.
