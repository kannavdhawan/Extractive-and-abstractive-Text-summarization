the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party rather than a good old british name is this indicative of the man contradictory vain and pompous i think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point. kilroy launches veritas party ex bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy silk said he wanted to change the face of british politics as he launched his new party. good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle. veritas it s the bnp in an expensive suit it s all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming that veritas is a party that doesn t believe in lies and spin but the truth of the matter is its completely useless due to proportional representation there is no chance that veritas will have any chance in claiming power and change the two horse race trend. he has remarkable ability to influence people but sadly after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him now goodbye he said.
