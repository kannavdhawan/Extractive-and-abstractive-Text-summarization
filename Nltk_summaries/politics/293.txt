veritas it's the bnp in an expensive suit it's all well and good robert kilroy silk claiming, that 'veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in lies and spin , but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two horse race trend. he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the european election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye', he said. the sooner we leave this corrupt super state the better does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro sceptic kilroy silk has used a latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old british' name is this indicative of the man contradictory, vain and pompous i think mr kilroy silk has got a very good point. we wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. mr kilroy silk, who recently quit the uk independence party, said our country was being stolen from us by mass immigration.
