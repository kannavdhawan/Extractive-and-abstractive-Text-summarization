but mr howard announced that of the 35bn he has earmarked from savings 12bn will be used to plug labour s claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin s first budget. defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely calculated timing tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard s latest announcement on taxation and spending. at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less . and many on the tory benches have been crying out for mr howard to get back onto the old tory tax cuts agenda. the big idea is his 35bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which mr howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.
