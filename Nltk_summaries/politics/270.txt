but mr howard announced that, of the 35bn he has earmarked from savings, 12bn will be used to plug labour's claimed financial black hole with any left over going to tax cuts in mr letwin's first budget. mr howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first. so it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when robert jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact. defection timed to hit tax pledge with impeccable and precisely calculated timing, tory defector robert jackson and his new labour bosses have attempted to overshadow michael howard's latest announcement on taxation and spending. at this election, people will have a clear choice between mr blair who will waste more and tax more and the conservative party which will give value for money and tax less . with just about everyone in westminster now working towards a may general election, mr howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the tories' resolutely depressing poll showings.
