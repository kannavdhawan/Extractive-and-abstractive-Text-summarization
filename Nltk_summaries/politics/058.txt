eu china arms ban 'to be lifted' the eu embargo on arms exports to china is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite us objections, uk foreign secretary jack straw has said. i have long understood china's argument, that to lump them in with, say, burma and zimbabwe is not appropriate and i don't think it is, he told the joint committee on strategic export controls. mr straw said the us government was suspicious of the motives of some other countries within the eu in wanting the ban lifted. he said it is more likely than not that the ban would be lifted before britain takes over the presidency of the eu from luxembourg in july. but he said many of washington's objections were based on a lack of information and understanding of how export control guidelines worked in eu countries. in december, the eu pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.
