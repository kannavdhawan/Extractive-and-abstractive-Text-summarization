crucial decision on super casinos a decision on whether to allow westminster to legislate on super casinos is set to be made by the scottish parliament. but the scottish national party and the tories say the issue of super casinos should be decided in scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility. the new gambling bill going through westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super casino will be built in scotland. a super casino in glasgow could be located at ibrox or the scottish exhibition and conference centre. the government has plans for up to eight las vegas style resorts in the uk, one of which is likely to be in glasgow.
