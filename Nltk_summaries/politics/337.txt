if a party is calling someone who is registered on tps and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned, said mr jones. but classic market research , such as a poll of voter intentions, did not constitute direct marketing, he said. if a party rings a person who is registered on tps to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them. in summary, whether a party calling tps registered voters to check their voting intentions will breach regulations will depend on the script used and whether the script is followed.
