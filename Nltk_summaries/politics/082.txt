mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july, said mr straw. the government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the british people, he said. we, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area, he said. mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher, was fully justified . mr ancram condemned the document, which the foreign office says has cost about 2,500 to design, print and deliver.
