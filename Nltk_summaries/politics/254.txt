ian gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring for goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. it is no secret in westminster, for example, that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner. and it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. the trouble is, both men have fallen short of offering simple, straightforward denials of the central claims. one only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound mr brown's leadership ambitions.
