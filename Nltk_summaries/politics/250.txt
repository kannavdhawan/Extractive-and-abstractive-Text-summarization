it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq. pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about 750. if you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that. but they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.
