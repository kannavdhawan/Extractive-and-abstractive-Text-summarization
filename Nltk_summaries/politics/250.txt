we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq. what the election should really be about a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner s full report into the issue. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.
