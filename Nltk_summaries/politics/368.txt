act on detention ruling, uk urged the government must act quickly on the law lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, mary robinson has said. what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to british citizens, she said. if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords. i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at, both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles, but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation, mr clarke said i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.
