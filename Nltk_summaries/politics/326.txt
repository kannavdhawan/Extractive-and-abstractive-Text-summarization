prime minister's questions so who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation michael howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is ramming through parliament the controversial new anti terror measures without proper debate. is not the opposition against to the proposed laws in principle , in which case delaying a decision for further debate would be pointless what this is really about, believes mr blair, is the tories spotting an opportunity to embarrass, maybe even defeat the government. as is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with mr kennedy than he had been with mr howard he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the lib dems have, once again, just missed the point. he didn't say so, but the tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election and they believe tony blair is using the issue to suggest the tories are soft on terrorism. the very first question to the prime minister from derby north's bob laxton asked him, in effect, if he would carry on the excellent policy of pouring more resources into schools. why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded.
