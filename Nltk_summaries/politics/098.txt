ministers deny care sums wrong ministers have insisted they are committed to free personal care for the elderly despite research suggesting the cost of the policy was under estimated. the rise in costs stems from a series of mistakes in the research used by the care development group of scottish executive experts who prepared the original costings according to findings published in the quarterly economic commentary of strathclyde university s fraser of allander institute. we will look in great detail at any contribution to this because we need to be sure we can provide free personal care and nursing care for our older people into the future. we need to know that the money is there not just for this year or next year but into the future so that older people and those who are looking forward to older age can rest assured that their personal care needs will be met. but the scottish national party called on ministers to reassure people that enough funding is in place to support the free personal care policy.
