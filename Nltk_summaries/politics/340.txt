the conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in november they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer. the lib dem's citizen's pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, mr kennedy argues. in september, trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said she would like to see longer paid maternity leave, higher paternity pay and the extension of flexible working rights to carers, if labour won a third term. she said these proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year, and hard working families will pay dearly, through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services . the labour party has committed itself to universal, affordable and flexible childcare for parents of all 3 to 14 year olds, including childcare centred on schools to be available from 8am to 6pm.
