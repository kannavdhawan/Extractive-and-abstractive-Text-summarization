minimum rate for foster parents foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced. but adss fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges. and with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in england, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets. payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just 50 a week for clothes, food and other costs. tony hunter, the organisation's president, said there are many devils and lots of details hidden within the government's proposals.
