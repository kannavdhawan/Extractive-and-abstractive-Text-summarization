the report, which followed a year long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group . the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives. it picked out the case of joseph scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16 year old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times.
