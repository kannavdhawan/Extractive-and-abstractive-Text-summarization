oleg gordievsky, a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british, said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. commenting on mr makarov's case, he said the british state is not a fat cow it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week. i believe the government of the united kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities took the information that victor makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold, mr kahn said.
