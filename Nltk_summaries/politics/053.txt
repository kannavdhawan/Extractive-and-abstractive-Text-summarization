oleg gordievsky, a senior kgb officer who became a secret agent for the british, said he was very happy with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. commenting on mr makarov's case, he said the british state is not a fat cow it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week. i believe the government of the united kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities took the information that victor makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold, mr kahn said. viktor makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the british authorities, who promised he would live like an average british citizen . but mr makarov's case has been backed by david kahn a former yale historian, and a leading expert on code breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the western allies. within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the british authorities he'd been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an mi6 agent in latvia.
