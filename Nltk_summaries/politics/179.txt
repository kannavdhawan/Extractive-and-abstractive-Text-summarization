farmer geoff brooks, a senior member of the quorn hunt, told bbc news people's lives revolved around hunting . anti hunt organisations, for whom the ban is the culmination of years of campaigning, say they hope most will stay within the law. mike hobday, of the league against cruel sports, told bbc news we've long urged them to go drag hunting to follow an artificial scent and that is what we hope they do. but the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits. a spokesman said basically, it's not going to be police officers chasing about in cars across fields, it will be based on intelligence and information received as well.
