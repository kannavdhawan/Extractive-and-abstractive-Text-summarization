labour mp praises tory campaign the conservatives have been a lot smarter in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a labour backbencher has said. a labour party spokesman played down differences with mr wyatt and said mr brown already had a prominent campaign role. labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and mr brown therefore had a prominent role. but mr wyatt argued by some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. however, mr wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget.
