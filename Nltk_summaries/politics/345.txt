the announcement from mr leslie who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe tory seat prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16. the votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to engage people by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective. the government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age, said mr leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24. even if the move does go ahead it is unlikely it will be in place before the next general election, widely predicted for may. currently candidates in both local and national votes must be 21 while the voting age is 18. that is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place. last april's report by the electoral commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21. the commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age. in a written statement, constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said the current minimum age of 21 for an mp would be reduced to 18. the proposals follow a recommendation last year by elections watchdog the electoral commission.
