bid to cut court witness stress new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor. lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90 of magistrates courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925 as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords he said and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. courts judges magistrates prosecutors police and victim support all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first without compromising the rights of the defendant.
