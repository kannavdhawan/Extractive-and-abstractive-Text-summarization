tsunami 'won't divert africa aid' uk aid to help the victims of the asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from africa, prime minister tony blair has promised. mr blair told sunday's programme since jack straw gave those figures a couple of days ago they haven't moved a great deal, which should give us some hope that we are beginning to reach the peak of the numbers. for the first time we have a plan that won't just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within african countries and conflict resolution, he said. mr blair told the bbc's breakfast with frost show the money spent on the tsunami would not invade the money britain wanted to spend on africa. but he pledged that africa which sees a preventable tsunami size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty would not be neglected. as britain takes up its presidency of the g8 group of leading nations, mr blair said ministers had a big agenda for africa.
