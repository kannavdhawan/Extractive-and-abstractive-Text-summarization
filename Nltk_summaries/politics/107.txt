as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities. bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown's article was a warning shot to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. the prime minister was asked about mr brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4's today programme. mr blair said he was taking nothing for granted ahead of the vote warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win. mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was in part because of mr brown's management of the economy. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.
