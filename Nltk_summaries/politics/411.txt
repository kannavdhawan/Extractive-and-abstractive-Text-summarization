their latest poster campaign flags up a range of policies from better school discipline, cleaner hospitals i mean, how hard is it to keep a hospital clean and immigration it's not racist to impose limits on immigration under the headline are you thinking what we are thinking this, they say, contrasts with labour's negative campaigning, such as its now infamous flying pigs poster. the speech, which was peppered with references to mr howard's humble beginnings as the child of immigrants , had been introduced by his son nick, a trainee vicar, who praised his father's honesty. michael howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to peter hain's description of him as an attack mongrel , claiming such personal abuse meant labour was rattled by the tory challenge. the peter hain mongrel attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong a by product, he claims, of the tories setting the agenda. the tories still have a mountain climb if michael howard is to walk through the doors of number 10. even allowing for the natural bias against the tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead. much of the credit for the tories' recent change of fortune must go to lynton crosby, the australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no hoper john howard, of australia's liberal party, into a serial election winner.
