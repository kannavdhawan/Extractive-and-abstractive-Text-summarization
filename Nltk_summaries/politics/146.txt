trade secretary patricia hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a commons written statement, would raise up to 680m for britain's nuclear clean up programme, under the new nuclear decommissioning agency. at the moment, this waste is stored at sellafield, in cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. intermediate waste from countries such as japan, germany, spain, italy, switzerland and sweden will be stored permanently in the uk. in future, only highly radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally germany or japan, under armed guard. under current contracts, british nuclear fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. mr baker, the lib dem environment spokesman, said i have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times.
