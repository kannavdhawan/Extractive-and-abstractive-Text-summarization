ahead of sunday's meeting in london, ms hewitt said she was proud of the uk's vibrant games industry but was concerned too many children were playing games which should only be sold to adults. anyone convicted of selling an 18 rated game to a child can be jailed for six months and fined up to 5,000. rockstar games, the makers of manhunt, has said in the past it markets its games responsibly and only targets its adverts at adults.
