relations between mr brown and mr milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since mr blair brought the latter back into the cabinet to run labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by mr brown in both 1997 and 2001. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party on monday i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. new speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in brown's britain, by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, which suggested mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown.
