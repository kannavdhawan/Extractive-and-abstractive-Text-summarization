on saturday, the lib dem chief executive said it was just a cock up that mr kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. nobody had any idea that was going to happen, lord rennard told reporters at the party conference. responding to the claims tory party co chairman liam fox said like labour, the lib dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving europe more control over our lives. only the liberal democrats stood against the iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on id cards, anti terror measures and taxation. the money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. . mr kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing monday's commons vote on the government's controversial anti terrorism laws, along with 16 other lib dem mps.
