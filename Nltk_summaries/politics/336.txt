the problem, according to mr lane, is not continuing divisions over iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but mr blair himself. a group of shop stewards from the swan hunter shipyard, who said they were facing redundancy, could barely suppress their anger at mr blair's failure to, as they saw it, shake off his tory leanings and stand up for manufacturing in the north east. labour's core support takes stock tony blair has told labour supporters he's back and still hungry for the job of prime minister but does that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in gateshead the electorate are keener on the government than some labour party members, is the dry assessment of graham lane, leader of the labour group on newham council. stephen douglas, 26, from wales, said after the pm's speech on sunday i think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues. katrina bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said mr blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots i think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout.
