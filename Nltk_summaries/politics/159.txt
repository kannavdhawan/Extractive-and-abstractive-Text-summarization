howard unveils election platform the conservatives would stand up for the forgotten majority , michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto. the decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder, he says. in the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard says he will produce a timetable for action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. saying britain must change direction, mr howard argues government is too big and cannot continue down the path of ever rising taxes .
