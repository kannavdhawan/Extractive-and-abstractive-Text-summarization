visa decision 'every 11 minutes' visa processing staff are sometimes expected to rule on an application every 11 minutes, mps have said. he added that the traditional system of a dual decision making process for all pre entry applications will be replaced by a single pre entry check at post, which will be simpler and more robust against abuse than the current system . committee members said the home office had been wrong to dismiss concerns from visa staff abroad who feared the system was being abused. entry clearance staff are expected to deal with a visa application in about 11 minutes which is surely too little time to look closely at the supporting documents. pressure was placed on staff to be efficient, rather than to do a thorough examination of an application, the public accounts committee found.
