moazzam begg, from birmingham, and martin mubanga, richard belmar and feroz abbasi, from london, have been held by the us at guantanamo bay for almost three years. following mr straw's announcement, lawyer louise christian, who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. in december the house of lords, the uk's highest court, ruled that the anti terror measures broke human rights laws. the archbishop added whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind we in south africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable. shami chakrabarti, director of civil rights group liberty, has called on the government to practise what it preaches and either free or charge the detained men. a spokesman said these individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence, such as that provided by third parties, cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk.
