he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge an additional figure of about 200. also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales, where there are no plans for top up fees, have also risen, by 19%. director, david caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities, but this was not a major factor. in june last year, mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by 2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. universities scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. he told bbc radio scotland's good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top up fees of up to 3,000 a year being introduced in england.
