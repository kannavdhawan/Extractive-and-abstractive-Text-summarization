in june last year mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by 2 000 in an attempt to prevent a cross border flood although no figure has yet been agreed. he told bbc radio scotland s good morning scotland programme the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study. applications from england and wales rose by 17 between january 2005 and the previous year up 23 600 to 27 700. fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid top up fees of up to 3 000 a year being introduced in england. legislation to introduce the top up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all. very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.
