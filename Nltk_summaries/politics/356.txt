carl emmerson, from the institute for fiscal studies, told bbc news he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be ok. we're not so sure. in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all, mr blair said. vincent cable, for the liberal democrats, called on mr brown to open up the government's books to the national audit office, to see if he had met his golden rule . mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the cornerstone of labour's programme. david page, of investec securities, said his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of 8bn is way too optimistic.
