ashok vishwanathan of operation black vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected. labour in constituency race row labour's choice of a white candidate for one of the uk's most multi racial seats proves the need for all black short lists, says a race group. local councillor lyn brown was selected for west ham, east london, in a contest between two white and five ethnic minority women. if ethnic minorities were represented in the house of commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority mps. i think all black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates, mr vishwanathan said.
