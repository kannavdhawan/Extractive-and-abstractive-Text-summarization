within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe, sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government. he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government, help draw up the government's programme, or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives. the following day, the stickling points had clearly become two fold mr thorpe's colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edward's resignation. sir edward, who had received more votes but had fewer mps, believed he had the authority to remain at number 10 providing the 14 liberal mps would support his government. hours later sir edward's hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe's colleagues refused to support him. according to the documents released at the national archives, the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal.
