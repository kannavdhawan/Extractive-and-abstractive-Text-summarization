within hours of his final talks with mr thorpe sir edward told the nation he was resigning and the queen invited mr wilson to form a new minority government. hours later sir edward s hopes of a deal unravelled as mr thorpe s colleagues refused to support him. he said the liberals could keep out labour in three ways lend ad hoc support to his minority government help draw up the government s programme or have up to three cabinet members in a coalition with the conservatives. according to the documents released at the national archives the friendly and easy first meeting indicated that both sir edward and mr thorpe thought they had the makings of a deal. the following day the stickling points had clearly become two fold mr thorpe s colleagues wanted electoral reform and sir edward s resignation.
