howard and blair tax pledge clash tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre election platform, with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the authentic opposition , particularly on the iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. mr howard told mps that every independent expert from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes . the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post election budget.
