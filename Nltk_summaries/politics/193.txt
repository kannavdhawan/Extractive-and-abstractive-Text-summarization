tories attack eu asylum moves david blunkett has been accused of using the politics of confusion to disguise new eu immigration measures. and he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the eu constitution, which voters in the uk had been promised a referendum over. if we don't like what other eu countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt in or out to suit the british people, he said. mr davis said once britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out leaving the uk open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant. the 25 member states are expected to scrap the requirement for unanimous agreement on immigration policy, in favour of the qualified majority voting qmv system.
