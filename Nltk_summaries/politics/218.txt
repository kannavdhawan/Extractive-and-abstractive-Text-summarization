according to a new book, brown's britain, mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. mr blair said the claims were reheated from six months ago and that he was concentrating on running the country. but, in a wide ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster, the middle east peace process and northern ireland, mr blair said when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown, but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright, but in private i don't think the relationship is good because brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed particularly over this issue of the leadership. the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was getting in the way of good government .
