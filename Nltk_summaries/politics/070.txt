home affairs spokesman mark oaten told bbc radio 4's today programme it's a matter of principle for us that we can't have a situation where the home secretary is able to impose house detention now on uk nationals as well as foreign nationals. home secretary charles clarke said there was not enough evidence to keep the egyptian man, known only as c, certified as a terrorist suspect. we think there could be a role for some form of control order tagging, surveillance, limitation on use of mobile phones but not with the home secretary's say so. michael howard said he would not back the home secretary's plans for control orders which include home detention. on monday, the legal team for two algerian suspects being held without trial told a court the men did not want bail if it meant being put under house arrest. that must be done with a proper judicial process, a judge involved in making those decisions, said mr oaten.
