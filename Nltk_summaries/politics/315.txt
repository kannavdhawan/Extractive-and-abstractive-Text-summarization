lib dem sir archy kirkwood who chairs the commons work and pensions committee said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the clear impression the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case and he may be seeking new employment opportunities. in november when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smith s departure mr johnson said i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead. tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced. in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the failing agency noting the chief executive has now left and hoping the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation . a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found.
