kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a fundamental lack of trust of tony blair as prime minister. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top up fees introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics. mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party s plans to increase income tax to 50 for those earning more than 100 000 saying it would apply to just 1 of the population. 1983 was when i was first elected as an mp so tony blair michael howard and myself were all class of 83 and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition he said.
