concerns at school diploma plan final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for england s secondary schools put forward by the tomlinson report. it will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half hearted response said the chairman of the commons education select committee labour mp barry sheerman. the government s response to the plan for a four tier diploma to replace all existing 14 19 qualifications is expected next week. another dissenter is sir mike tomlinson s predecessor as chief schools inspector professor chris woodhead who has said there is no need for such a massive upheaval . but people understand that a white paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the department for education and skills.
