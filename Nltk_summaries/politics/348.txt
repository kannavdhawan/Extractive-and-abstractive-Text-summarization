what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no one has heard directly from the prime minister, he said. if mr blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, lord holme said. last month he said we answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons i have given before, the answer is no, he said at his monthly news conference. it would then be up to tony blair, michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non partisan charity said. lord holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements .
