if mr blair did not want to take part the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why lord holme said. what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate no one has heard directly from the prime minister he said. the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead as soon as the election is called. last month he said we answer this every election campaign and for the reasons i have given before the answer is no he said at his monthly news conference.
