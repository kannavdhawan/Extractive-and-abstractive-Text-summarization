the research, carried out by transport expert professor richard allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the uk's roads compared with 2003. he estimates that this would save the country 119m a year. these have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including labour backbencher gwyneth dunwoody, who says it will reduce the incentive for drivers to stay within the limits in residential areas, leading to more road casualties. in an article for the times newspaper, ms dunwoody, who chairs the transport select committee, says slight increases to low car speeds increase hugely the risks to pedestrians and cyclists. professor allsop said reducing the limit from 80mg to 50mg can be expected to save around 65 lives a year or around half of those who die in accidents where the driver's bac blood alcohol content is within 30mg of the current limit. the road safety bill, which gets its second reading on tuesday, would allow the results of roadside breath tests to be used in court currently a blood test is needed. new drink limit 'would cut toll' more lives than previously thought could be saved by cutting drink drive limits by a third, a report says.
