i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don t believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn the it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12 000 a year with say no tax on below 6 000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100 000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50 60 more here than they do in the u . on the contrary mr blair wins he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as wel i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss eithe
