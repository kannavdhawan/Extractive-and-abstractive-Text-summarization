i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won t take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don t believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12 000 a year with say no tax on below 6 000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100 000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us perhaps we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50 60 more here than they do in the us. i can t believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you it s about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn t go a miss either. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2.75 an hour and working as hard as any of the older staff maybe it s about time 16 21 year olds got a fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the lower status jobs.
