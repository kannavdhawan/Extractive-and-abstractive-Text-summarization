it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12,000 a year, with say no tax on below 6,000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100,000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50 60% more here than they do in the us. i know about this great idea don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage.
