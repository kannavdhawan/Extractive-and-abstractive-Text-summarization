it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below 12,000 a year, with say no tax on below 6,000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over 100,000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2 3rds of the us perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50 60% more here than they do in the us. i know about this great idea don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage. i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door i don't believe in the minimum wage at all i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. adults must be paid at least 5.05 an hour, up from 4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid 4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a 6 rate. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid 2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 21 year olds got a fair wage we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.
