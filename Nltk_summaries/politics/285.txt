tim collins, the shadow education secretary, said last week it would be a huge boost to the party if mr hague returned to the front bench. mr hague, who recently had published the biography of william pitt the younger, also said he wanted to continue writing books and speech writing. mr hague became an mp at 27 and leader of the opposition at 36. he said i feel fortunate that, by the age of 40, i had crammed in an entire political career. mr hague, 43, told the daily telegraph he would now find a life dominated by politics too boring and unfulfilling. mr hague, who stepped down after his party's 2001 election defeat, does not rule out a return to the front bench.
