short attacks us over tsunami aid former cabinet minister clare short has criticised the us led tsunami aid coalition, saying the un should be leading efforts. i don't know what that is about but it sounds very much, i am afraid, like the us trying to have a separate operation and not work with the rest of the world through the un system, she added. i think this initiative from america to set up four countries claiming to co ordinate sounds like yet another attempt to undermine the un when it is the best system we have got and the one that needs building up, she said. president bush has announced that an alliance of the us, india, australia and japan will co ordinate a humanitarian drive. the us was very bad at coordinating with anyone and india had its own problems, ms short said.
