prudence made an appearance, albeit towards the end of his address, as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which, he claimed, would be thrown away by anyone else. so if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from mr brown's red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government. as ever, there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties' treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor's red book, which sets out the fine detail of his budget, in an attempt to spot the flaws. as always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election. where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering, mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown's forecasts to the prime minister's forecasts on iraq's weapons of mass destruction. labour mps, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is.
