brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that didn t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes. where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction. and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election. tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use. so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government.
