a study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, scottish borders council, midlothian council and scottish borders enterprise, found that a half hourly service from tweedbank to edinburgh could cover its operating costs. anne borthwick, of campaign for borders rail, said reopening the waverley line would restore the area's prosperity. campaigners have said that reopening the waverley line, which could cost up to 100m, would be a huge economic boost for the borders. they will mark the 36th anniversary of the line closure, which ran from edinburgh through the borders and on to carlisle, with a walk at tweedbank. campaign for borders rail is the biggest independent lobby group in scotland and we have been lobbying tirelessly for the reinstatement of rail services to the borders and eventually to carlisle.
