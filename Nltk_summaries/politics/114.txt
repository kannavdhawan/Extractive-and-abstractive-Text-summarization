green fear for transport ballot the green party is concerned thousands of residents may not be able to vote in edinburgh's transport referendum. the ballot will ask residents to vote for or against the council's proposed congestion charge scheme and a host of transport improvements to be funded by it. however, there is still time for those who are not on the list to contact the council and make sure they are sent ballot forms ahead of february's voting deadline. towards the end of february, the council will meet to decide whether to proceed with an application to scottish ministers for approval for its planned congestion charging scheme and the other parts of its transport package. it is therefore vital that as many residents as possible in edinburgh city and the surrounding areas, are registered to vote in the ballot.
