russell tanguay, agent for arundel and south downs tories, said mr flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. the mp, who is consulting his lawyers, told bbc news they selected me and they, if you like, dispose of me or keep me. two local councillors who back mr flight met mr tanguay and the local association's chairman in arundel on tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. mr tanguay backed that view on tuesday, saying howard flight is ineligible to stand as a conservative party candidate. the comments were not a one off , he said, claiming mr howard and other senior tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending.
