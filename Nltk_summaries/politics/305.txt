mr milburn said labour's media effort this time would focus more on local newspapers and broadcasters, with every local radio station given the chance to interview the prime minister. the tone of the campaign, said mr milburn, would be more conversational than rhetorical more spontaneous less scripted less national more local and less based on issues and more concentrated on people. mr milburn said the economy would take centre stage in labour's campaign in what would be a watershed election and the last stand of the thatcherites . at a time when the british people are looking for more accountability and openness, this government turns its back on them abandoning plans to tour the country and scared to face journalists in a press conference it does rather beg the question, 'what have they got to hide ' the general election is widely expected next may and all the parties are stepping up their campaign preparations. labour battle plan 'hides blair' the tories have accused tony blair of being terrified of scrutiny after labour unveiled details of how it will fight the next general election. mr milburn said labour's slogan would be britain is working don't let the tories wreck it.
