this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of 35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 60bn more. laying into the conservative's record in government he said i give you this promise with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, 3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.
