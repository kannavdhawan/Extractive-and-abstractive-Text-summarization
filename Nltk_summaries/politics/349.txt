this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of 35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 60bn more. laying into the conservative's record in government he said i give you this promise with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, 3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, george osborne, said this was more talk from gordon brown. for all his trumpeting of labour's management of the economy, gordon brown's record is very mixed, he said. to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country. he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17 year olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave.
