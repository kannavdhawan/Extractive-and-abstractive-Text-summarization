the two day european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eu's budget for 2007 13. the wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006. the uk, france, germany, austria, the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes the commission wants it to be 1.26%. 'uk will stand firm on eu rebate' britain's 3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's european council summit, jack straw said. the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time. the foreign secretary told mps the rebate, secured by margaret thatcher in 1984, was entirely justified . mr straw said the eu commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.
