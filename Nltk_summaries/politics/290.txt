i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth. like many of your respondents i wouldn t usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share but in the instance of opposing charles clark s proposals for house arrest i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth. sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the british people who have lived in a democracy protected by tony blair and others of like mind who mr. forsyth seems to be putting along side the scruffy little austrian. i agree in many ways with what mr forsyth has said if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk how can we accuse countries such as zimbabwe and burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent it is hypocrisy of the highest order. forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism 3000 people died in one morning in ny on september 11th 2001. the threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.
