we, as a nation are in grave danger of being duped by pro us propaganda, which of course also means we'll inherit most, if not all of their total paranoia, and allow our governments, of any political persuasion incidentally, to gradually, and insidiously, impose a police state by well tried tested back door methods. but in the 66 years that i have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us. like many of your respondents, i wouldn't usually think of mr forsyth as someone whose views i share, but in the instance of opposing charles clark's proposals for house arrest, i agree wholeheartedly with mr forsyth i agree with mr forsyth. who is to decide whom is a suspect why should we believe them who can have faith in the honesty, integrity, and competence of our intelligence services and politicians in light of the events of recent years what is to stop false denunciations what of those falsely accused who will lose their careers who will support their families will their children still go to school it smacks to me of the methods of nazi germany, stalin's russia, ceausescu's romania the list goes on. yes, there has been oppression by the british government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge trial etc.
