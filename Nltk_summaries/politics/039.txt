she told good morning wales just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said i likened the government to bolshevik russia or hitler's germany, the actual quote i gave was 'it is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. it was announced last july that three welsh quangos, education and training body elwa, the wales tourist board and the welsh development agency, would be brought under assembly government control. 'hitler' row over welsh arts cash an artist critical of welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in russia and germany. but ms james, who won the 30,000 jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. as we know from past european history, i. e. russia and germany in the early 20th century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'.
