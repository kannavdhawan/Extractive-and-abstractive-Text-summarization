if there was to be a cap, it should be 10,000 a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. 'debate needed' on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. there were almost 68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly 12m of them from individual gifts worth more than 1m. while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible, says its report. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.
