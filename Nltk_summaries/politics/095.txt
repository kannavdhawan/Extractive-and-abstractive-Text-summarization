it suited the purpose of mr baume's union, the first division association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, mr brown told bbc radio 4's today programme. jonathan baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of competing agendas between mr brown and mr blair. on wednesday, ahead of the chancellor's pre budget report, mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes conflicting and competing agendas for government between number 10 and the treasury. government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. mr brown said to be honest i don't think you can rely on his mr baume's judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge.
