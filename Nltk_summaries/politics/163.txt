kinnock to urge reform in lords neil kinnock has said his acceptance of a seat in the house of lords will allow him to help achieve further progress with substantial democratic reform. it was pointed out to me that if the additional democratic reform is going to take place it is going to require advocates in the lords and people there willing to vote for it. mr kinnock said he thought about the decision for quite a long time because he had long had reservations about the lords. on the bbc s breakfast with frost it was put to mr kinnock that he had once referred to lords members as brigands muggers bribers and gangsters . the former labour leader said he would probably take the title of lord kinnock of bedwellty his first constituency for which he was selected in 1969.
