lord faulkner of worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges because of the facility they provide to bet against a result has increased the potential for corruption. the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up audit trails something the new betting exchanges already do to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced. lord condon, head of the international cricket council's anti corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two year penalty was derisory . as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves. it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating. symbolically, a higher penalty, perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses, might be appropriate.
