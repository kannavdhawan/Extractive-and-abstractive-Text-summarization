lord faulkner of worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges because of the facility they provide to bet against a result has increased the potential for corruption. the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up audit trails something the new betting exchanges already do to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.
