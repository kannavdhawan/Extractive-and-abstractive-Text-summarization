in his speech, mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both britain's hard won economic stability the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades and the key investment in public services. everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services, he said. in response, david davis said the tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match labour's spending on health and education. he still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people schools, hospitals and police and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes, mr letwin said. the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a tory government, he concluded.
