in his speech mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party which had learned to occupy the political centre ground with a hidebound tory party which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk both britain s hard won economic stability the lowest mortgages inflation unemployment for decades and the key investment in public services. in response david davis said the tories would make cuts such as removing regional assemblies but would bring in more police officers and match labour s spending on health and education. meanwhile tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of misrepresenting the party s proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans. on saturday tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing inefficiencies which had burgeoned under labour.
