a new book, brown's britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, says mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. it has caused a new wave of concern among labour mps gearing up to defend their seats in an election, widely expected to be held in may, and several members are understood to have lined up to express their discontent at the plp meeting. he told bbc news those who co operate or inspire these books, in my view, have to know that, whatever the short term political or personal advantage that they think they might secure, they always do it by damaging the record, the unity and the re election chances of the labour party and the government. mr blair told the parliamentary labour party plp on monday i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. ex labour leader neil kinnock said mr blair and mr brown could only deal with the media frenzy by continuing to say they would not allow a row to damage labour or british interests. on monday, mr blair's spokesman said the prime minister is determined that he will get on with the business of government because he believes that what people want.
