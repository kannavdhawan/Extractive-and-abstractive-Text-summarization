row over 'police' power for csos the police federation has said it strongly opposes giving community support officers csos the power to detain suspects for up to 30 minutes. while the answer is a lot more real police, the government wants to recruit 25,000 people who can't arrest anyone, he said. the serious organised crime and police bill proposes extra powers to search suspects, enforce licensing offences, direct traffic and deter begging. police federation chairman jan berry said civilian officers should act as eyes and ears for the police. the federation said csos do not have the experience, training and safety equipment to deal with potentially confrontational situations.
