tories would cut number of mps the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one fifth if they were elected tory leader michael howard has said. the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. in northern ireland it was just over 66 000 in wales just over 59 000 and in scotland 53 000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall labour by more than 80 000 and the tories by almost 100 000 they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england.
