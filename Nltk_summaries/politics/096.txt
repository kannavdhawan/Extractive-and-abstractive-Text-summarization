the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. tories 'would cut number of mps' the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one fifth if they were elected, tory leader michael howard has said. in northern ireland it was just over 66,000, in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the plan would also even out the great unfairness of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers.
