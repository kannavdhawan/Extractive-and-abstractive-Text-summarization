at heathrow, gatwick, edinburgh and glasgow airports, baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004, which will close next week. among other measures, baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. stop stansted expansion said the white paper, published in december 2003, was fundamentally flawed and did not follow the proper consultation process. at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper, said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. baa, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities.
