it said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in eu funds in the uk in 2003, worth 38.5m 52m euros , up from 831 cases worth 35.7m in 2002. at the same time, reported fraud throughout the eu dropped from 10,276 cases worth 808m to 8,177 cases worth 644m. eu fraud clampdown urged eu member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in eu funds on a consistent basis, the uk's public spending watchdog has said. he added that there is generally good co operation with member states and the anti fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by nao providing a good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud . any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the uk taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the community, he said. the national audit office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the eu still had no common definition of fraud. the government must take the opportunity afforded by the uk presidency of the eu to press the commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management.
