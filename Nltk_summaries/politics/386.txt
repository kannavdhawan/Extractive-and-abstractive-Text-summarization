straw backs ending china embargo uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union s arms embargo on china despite opposition from the us and japan. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe. the result of any decision to lift the arms embargo should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china either in quantitative or qualitative terms mr straw said. but mr straw insisted the eu s code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted. he said mr straw was naive beyond belief if he accepted china s claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.
