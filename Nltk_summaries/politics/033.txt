at heathrow, gatwick, edinburgh and glasgow airports, baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004, which will close next week. the stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year. at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. lord hanningfield, leader of essex county council, told bbc radio 4's today programme we are going to the high court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at luton airport, or when it changed take off and landing procedures at heathrow. if the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport white paper could be left in ruins.
