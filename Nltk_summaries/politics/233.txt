'few ready' for information act thousands of public bodies are ill prepared for the freedom of information act, due to come into force next month, because of government failures, say mps. it has delivered a simple, liberal fees regime, guidance on the act which has been widely praised, and expert networks of staff working on freedom of information implementation. our report shows that in the past support and guidance from the dca, which has overall responsibility for guiding the public sector through the process of implementation for the freedom of information regime, has been lacking. but the government department responsible for implementing the change suffered from an unusually high turnover of staff within the department, which had seriously interfered with its work, said the constitutional affairs select committee. committee chairman alan beith said the dca has had four years to prepare for freedom of information, but with less than a month to go it appears that some bodies may not be well enough prepared. it said, despite four years of preparations, some local authorities and parts of the health sector were still not ready.
