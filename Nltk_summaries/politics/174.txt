however, my understanding is that, under the mental health legislation, the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence, would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers. ferguson, who slashed a man in a doctors' surgery in coatbridge in 1994, had been out to see his fianc e annabella holmes, 47, whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire. the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers, they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave, but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it. he is described as being 5ft 9ins tall, slim, with blond hair, blue eyes and a fair complexion. she said ministers were told of that, notified of it, but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off. scottish conservative leader, david mcletchie, said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen .
