iraq advice claim sparks new row the tories say ministers must respond in parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the iraq war was drawn up at number 10. downing street has denied the claims made in a new book about the attorney general lord goldsmith s advice. he said the claims suggested parliament had only received a pr cis of lord goldsmith s second opinion and that it was actually drafted in no 10. this would be wrong even if lord goldsmith had signed the statement mr cook said because the attorney general s advice should be an independent legal opinion not subject to political negotiation of this kind . in a statement to newsnight lord goldsmith said in my parliamentary answer on march 17 2003 i explained my genuinely held independent view that military action was lawful under the existing security council resolutions. according to mr sands lord goldsmith had warned tony blair in a document on 7 march 2003 that the use of force against iraq could be illegal and that it would have been safer to seek a second un resolution sanctioning military action. after that downing street proceeded to set out his lord goldsmith s view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 march said mr sands.
