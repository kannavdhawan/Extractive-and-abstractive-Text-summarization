commenting on mr mcletchie's decision to stand down, a scottish labour party spokesman said this should mean mr mcletchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. peter misselbrook, executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year. explaining his reason for quitting the post, mr mcletchie said i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray. however, msps' code of conduct recognises a wider definition of parliamentary proceedings, including a non statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions. he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy, she said.
