on thursday, mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he told mps if we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying it is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were weighted overwhelmingly in favour of the householder, said mr clarke.
