a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said of mr smith's honour the award reflects all that he has achieved in a civil service career, principally in the inland revenue, spanning over 40 years not just his role as chief executive of the child support agency. mr smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by work and pensions secretary alan smith in november, is made a commander of the order of bath. ex chief inspector of schools mr tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing a levels and gcses with a new diploma system in a shake up of the exams system. former natwest chief executive mr wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the nhs. both men were giving evidence to a commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. but sir alan budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.
