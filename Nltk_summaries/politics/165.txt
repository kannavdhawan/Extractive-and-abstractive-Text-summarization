police urge pub closure power new powers are needed to close disorderly pubs bars and clubs for up to a week or even permanently police chiefs have told mps. mr fox said the new laws due to start being phased in next month could help if food outlets public transport and public toilets could cope with late night drinkers. the new licensing laws will give police greater powers to close pubs and clubs but only for 24 hour periods. association of chief police officers president chris fox said the current 24 hour closure power did not have enough impact on bad landlords. after the meeting mr fox said being able to close premises for only 24 hours did not necessarily make an impact.
