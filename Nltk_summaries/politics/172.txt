i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non traditional relationships, said mr bell. badly taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell, and in a speech to the hansard society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. i worry that many young people are being educated in faith based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society, said mr bell. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools which he said included about 100 muslim, 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools. independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief, david bell, for not doing enough to promote the wider tenets of british society . faith schools citizenship warning schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.
