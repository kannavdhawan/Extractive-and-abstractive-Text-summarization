speaking on bbc radio scotland's sunday live programme, ms jamieson described friday's meeting as very productive and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. that is the kind of thing we want to stop and that's the kind of thing supporters' groups are very clear they don't want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that. we have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top, who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches, to be able to stop them attending the games. both rangers and celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people. ms jamieson praised the police for their action and said the police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence they will crack down very effectively on them. they plan to hold an anti sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited.
