mr brown, meanwhile, is visiting tanzania, mozambique and kenya to highlight the plight of many africans hit by aids, war and famine issues which mr blair has also spoken out on. at a campaign poster launch on tuesday, mr brown was joined by alan milburn, who mr blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. mr blair told mps and peers i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need. mr blair then changed his mind in june 2004, after cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes mr peston. on tuesday, deputy prime minister mr prescott told bbc news they told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders get in line. the new book claims mr prescott hosted a dinner in november 2003 where the prime minister told mr brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the iraq war.
