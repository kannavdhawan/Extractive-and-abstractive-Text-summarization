tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80,000 long term care places had been lost since 1997. after eight years of persistent change, dogmatic enforcement of regulation, and overbearing government initiatives we need action, not a vision, said mr burns. ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. the lib dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over 100,000. health spokesman paul burstow said promoting independence sounds good and helping people to live in their own homes is a goal we share. plan to give elderly care control elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans. and tony hunter, president of the association of directors of social services, said the plans could improve dignity and well being for thousands of people.
