as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect. for example, will those brownite briefers suggest their man is unhappy at the prime minister's timing or subject matter, as may have been the case in the past what all seem agreed on, however, is that this sniping simply cannot be allowed to go on through the election campaign. similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said. the dressing down appears to have done the trick, with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown's stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. stephen pound echoed the message, saying we know that the one thing that could entirely jeopardise what we are trying to achieve, not for the labour party but for this country, is the appearance of division. even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that, while mr brown is in africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.
