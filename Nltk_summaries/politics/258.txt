the dressing down appears to have done the trick with mr brown joining his alleged rival alan milburn who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in mr brown s stead and deputy prime minister john prescott at an election poster launch. the views expressed by both backbenchers and labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely held view within the labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election. as paul flynn said what has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times when we wanted to come together we wanted to lead on the global issues to change politics for the next decade the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party two people we greatly respect. even as the mps were expressing their fears it emerged that while mr brown is in africa for a week the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term. labour mps fears over squabbling if there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of labour mps it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.
