if as expected his party increases its showing at the election he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us . mr kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned labour voters. but doesn t that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached including by conservatives that the conservatives are not going to win this election. we are being straightforward with people saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies . therefore the potential is there for the liberal democrat advance to be one of the big stories of the election given that we have the capacity to take on labour and win as well as take on the conservatives and win.
