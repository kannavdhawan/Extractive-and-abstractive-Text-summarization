if, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because i see that as the decisive opportunity for us . but doesn't that lead to the jibe that his is a party actively bidding to come second he is prepared to go this far a clear conclusion has been reached, including by conservatives, that the conservatives are not going to win this election. in his 22 years in the commons, he has seen his fair share of such claims dashed on the rocks of bitter experience and, he might say, the uk's political and electoral system. we are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies . won't voters looking for an alternative to labour still naturally gravitate to the conservatives the problem is that, geographically, the conservative party has melted away in about a third of britain. that last remark reflects a view gaining ground in westminster that, if the tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.
