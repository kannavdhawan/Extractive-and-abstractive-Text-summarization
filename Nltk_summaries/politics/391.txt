'eu referendum could cost 80m' it could cost 80m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution, ministers have revealed. labour mp john cryer, whose question revealed the price estimate, said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum, held 30 years ago. in a written parliamentary answer, constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 after the predicted date for the next election.
