this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown's former girlfriend of five years, princess marguerite of romania, the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania, who said a relationship with him was politics, politics, politics . if that was true then, mr brown, who married pr executive sarah macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. mr blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute. events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster. he reached that milestone last june, when he overtook david lloyd george, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time.
