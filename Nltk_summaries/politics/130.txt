a spokeswoman for the department for international development said the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. if britain's proposal for an international finance facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008 09. these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least 1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least 1.5bn on hiv aids related work over the next three years. mr blair, who has described africa as a scar on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. the report said for rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity. 2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure, the charity's director added. some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, oxfam says in a report, paying the price.
