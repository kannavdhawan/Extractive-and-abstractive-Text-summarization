if there was to be a cap it should be 10 000 a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned 56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under 200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to 3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons european parliament scottish parliament welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly.  debate needed on donations cap a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet the elections watchdog has said. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions.
