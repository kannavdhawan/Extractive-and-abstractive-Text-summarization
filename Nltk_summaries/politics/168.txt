amanda's uncle, lewis champion, told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence. mps' murder sentence concern murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new mps' report. in july this year amanda champion's killer, james ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years it would have been longer had he denied the charge. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales, lord woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. at present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff the minimum term they must serve if the defendant pleads guilty. there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime, he said.
