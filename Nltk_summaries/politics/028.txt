the tories criticised the lib dem stance, saying mr oaten had initially said he accepted mr blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged. lib dems demand new inquiry a judge should look into the david blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the lib dems say. mr oaten said people would be mystified why sir alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. he said there is a strong case for a judge led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. sir alan budd's inquiry linked the ex home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex lover's nanny. but lib dem officials say mr oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.
