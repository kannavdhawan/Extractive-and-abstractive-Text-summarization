however, chief treasury secretary paul boateng said none of the tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is 35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard. mr howard said all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less. the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps, robert jackson, a former minister, to labour. and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives, leaving the tories with just 163 mps, two less than they returned atlabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906. almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes, mr howard insisted. because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both.
