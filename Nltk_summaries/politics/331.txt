labour attacked on howard poster labour has been accused of using anti semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin. jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members. the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying i can spend the same money twice. labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies.
