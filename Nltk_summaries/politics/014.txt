mr blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. the second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three monthly report on their use by an eminent and independent person . the bill proposes control orders , which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. in the commons, mr howard said it would be far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through . he went on to say if we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill. mr blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.
