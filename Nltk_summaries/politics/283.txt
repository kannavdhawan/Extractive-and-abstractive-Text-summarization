once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, mr kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings, while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases. but, unlike the old tory labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see modest tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services. similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration, with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard's proposals for quotas. mr kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the tories were not going to be significant players in the poll. with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.
