lib dems bold election policy charles kennedy has told voters his liberal democrats will offer them an honest choice at the next general election. the tories claim they can improve services and cut taxes through 35bn efficiency savings while labour has offered 22bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals although there is little chance they will propose increases. similarly there is a different tone to the lib dem approach to asylum and immigration with mr kennedy stressing politicians should not foment an artificial debate about immigration and attacking michael howard s proposals for quotas. mr kennedy went on to suggest the re election of a labour government with a small majority would amount to a massive vote of no confidence in tony blair s government. with the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes mr kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.
