tories pledge free sports lessons children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future tory government, the party has said. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1, 3 and 4 and two fifths of schools at key stage 2, met that target. the tories say labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. the club2school policy would provide up to 250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after school sport.
