on the war on iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the liberal democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives. but mr kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name. kennedy looks to election gains they may not know quite how to describe their position in british politics the real opposition, the valid opposition, the effective opposition or the authentic opposition. they would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the liberal democrats may genuinely have replaced the tories as the party challenging labour for power. he was also happy to break the two party consensus on taxation by promising to increase income tax on those earning more than 100,000 a year to pay for the scrapping of student fees, the introduction of free personal care for the elderly and replacing the council tax with a local income tax. but the liberal democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the tories, who are now the real threat to labour.
