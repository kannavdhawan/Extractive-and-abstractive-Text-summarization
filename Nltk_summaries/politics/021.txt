blair backs pre election budget tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown s pre budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy. in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity security and stability for all mr blair said. conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said i can t find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability which he said was the cornerstone of labour s programme. in his pre budget report mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3 and 3.5 for next year.
