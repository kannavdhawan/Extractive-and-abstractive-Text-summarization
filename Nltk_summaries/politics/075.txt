but here's old ken he's been crass, he's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language but i don't think actually if you read what he said, although it was extraordinary and rude, i don't think he was actually anti semitic. however, mr johnson, who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley, said mr blair should butt out of the row. mr johnson, mp for henley on thames, oxfordshire, said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war . later the prime minister said a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time, but in the circumstances, and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist, yes, he should apologise. ken doesn't think he's got anything to say sorry for and if that's really his feeling, then i think that he should stick to his guns, he said.
