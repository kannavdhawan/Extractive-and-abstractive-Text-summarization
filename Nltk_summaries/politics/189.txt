liberal democrat leader charles kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000. mr bush's first task was to rebuild a sense of domestic purpose within the us, he said. mr bush's re election came at a crucial time for a world that was fractured, divided and uncertain , mr blair said. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said a win by mr kerry would have given mr blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an umbilical cord between mr bush and the uk premier. but myron ebell, an adviser on climate change to president bush, has said there would be no change in the us stance and rejected the threat of climate change. mr kennedy said internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism. it had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the middle east and the conditions on which terrorists prey.
