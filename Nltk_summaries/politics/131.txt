given these circumstances, and the fact that raf fairford, and other military installations in the uk, had been the scene of increasingly destructive disorder in the weeks preceding this incident, the police commander on the ground made the decision to turn back the coaches. they had appealed against a high court decision that it was not unlawful for police to forcibly turn protestors away near raf fairford, glos, in 2003. the police had also sought to overturn a breach of human rights ruling arising from the same case. fairford coach action, representing more than 80 people who appealed against the police actions, say they are prepared to take their case to the european court of human rights. it followed action by police, when three coachloads of people were searched and detained on the way to raf fairford and forced to return to london under police escort. craig mackey, assistant chief constable of gloucestershire police, said we have always considered that our responses were proportionate and all our decisions on the day were based on intelligence.
