we will keep these hounds going, we will keep this community going and in the end we will come back and hunt when hunting is legal again, hunt master, captain ian farquhar, said. you can hunt a rat, but not a mouse, a rabbit but not a hare, an artificial scent, but not a real one, he said. john cooper, a barrister and chairman of the league against cruel sports, said the anti hunting lobby expects the authorities to prosecute wherever there is clear evidence of illegal hunting practices. but tony banks, labour mp for west ham, said the issue would soon disappear, and that people in a few years time will be wondering what it was all about . he said had the government not prevaricated since 1997 in introducing the ban, hunting with dogs would have passed into history like other former country pursuits such as otter hunting and badger baiting. as well as being able to mount a hunt for an artificial scent, it will still be legal for the hunts to flush out foxes, as long as they shoot their quarry rather than set the hounds on them.
