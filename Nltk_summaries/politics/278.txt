both parties have now completed their moves to new headquarters, with labour creating its election hub just three doors away from the tories' new headquarters in victoria street, just down the road from the commons. certainly the press conference hosted by election co ordinator alan milburn, in the rather compact new conference room still smelling of new carpet and with the garish new labour coffee mugs as yet unstained had all the hallmarks of an election event. along with work and pensions secretary alan johnson and minister for work jane kennedy, he then went on to tear into the tory plans to scrap the new deal welfare to work scheme, which they claimed would lead to an increase of almost 300,000 in unemployment. unlike 2001, there should be no need for colleagues to have taxis gunning their engines outside, or to buy scooters, to get themselves between the tightly timetabled events. labour has come up with a figure of 22 billions worth of efficiency savings so, understandably perhaps, believe mr howard must be planning cuts to squeeze the extra 13 billion. what really divides the parties so what is the gap between labour and the tories nowadays one starbucks, one rymans and one small greek cafe as it happens.
