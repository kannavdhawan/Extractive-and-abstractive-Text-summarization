lib dems 'to target stamp duty' the liberal democrats are promising to raise the stamp duty threshold if they win the general election, in a bid to court first time house buyers. vince cable, the party's treasury spokesman, said raising the threshold to 150,000 would prevent over 400,000 home buyers from paying the tax. first time buyers are being squeezed out of the housing market not only by higher house prices but also by being swept into the stamp duty net, he said. by pledging to increase the threshold to 150,000, the liberal democrats will make it possible for many first time buyers to buy a property without facing this tax. paul boateng mp, labour's chief secretary to the treasury, said the lib dems' sums don't add up. by failing to uprate the stamp duty threshold gordon brown has hit first time buyers and those on low incomes the hardest.
