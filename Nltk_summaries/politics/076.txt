lord bach, minister for defence procurement, said he was obviously still disappointed with the cost and time increases shown , but insisted that the defence procurement agency had undertaken a huge amount of work to expose any underlying problems on projects . a senior defence official, speaking to the bbc's defence correspondent paul adams, said that although the figures were still not good enough, the report reflected unrealistic expectations early on in the project cycle. our correspondent said it was the same projects, including the joint strike fighter, the nimrod and a400m aircraft and the type 45 destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over runs and delay. the latest findings follow a string of critical reports issued within the last 12 months, and, according to our correspondent, contain few new surprises. this year's overspend was significantly less than last year's 3.1bn total, and the defence procurement agency which is responsible for buying defence equipment was improving.
