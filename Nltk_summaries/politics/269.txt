teens know little of politics teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics and have little knowledge. many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english scottish or welsh rather than british while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone. only a quarter of 14 16 year olds knew that labour was the government the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party. almost all could identify tony blair but only one in six knew who michael howard was and just one in 10 recognised charles kennedy. nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for.
