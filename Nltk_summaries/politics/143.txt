labour mp diane abbot, who backs mr phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority mps keith vaz, paul boateng and bernie grant in 1987 but it took another 10 years before another black woman was able to win a seat. appearing on bbc radio 4's today programme, mr malik, who is himself running for the seat of dewsbury, acknowledged that so far women only shortlists had failed to deliver a boost in the number of ethnic minority candidates. shahid malik, who is on labour's ruling nec, accepted people's frustration but said there should be targets not lists to boost representation of minorities. if we get to the other side of the general election and find that minorities are not represented, we have to say that after 20 or 30 years of talking about this, we cannot go on the same way, he said. that came after it emerged that one of britain's most ethnically diverse constituency, west ham, was to get a women only shortlist for the next election following an nec ruling.
