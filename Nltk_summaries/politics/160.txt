according to the independent, his resignation is expected to be followed by those of five other barristers nicholas blake qc, andrew nicol qc, manjit singh gill qc, rick scannell and tom de la mare. without that you are having detention with no habeus corpus and really a blot, as ian mcdonald has said, on our legal landscape, something really quite shocking with regard to the rule of the law. under the anti terrorism, crime and security act introduced by the government in 2001 in response to the 11 september attacks, foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who cannot be deported can be held indefinitely without trial. helena kennedy, a labour peer and a human rights lawyer, said the special advocates' main concern was that once they had seen any special intelligence they were not allowed to speak to the detainees. they are all believed to be carefully considering their positions on the panel of special advocates who represent detainees before the special immigration appeals commission siac a secure court without a jury, which tries terror suspects. they are now in a situation where everything they have been trained to believe in, the right to trial by jury, has been abandoned and that is what gives some of them sleepless nights.
