turkey deal to help world peace a deal bringing turkey a step closer to eu membership is of fundamental importance to the peace and security of the world tony blair has said. the internationally recognised southern part of cyprus is an eu member but turkey which occupies northern cyprus had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country calling the issue a red line . the eu has also announced that it will start accession talks with croatia in april 2005. however talks will begin only if the country co operates fully with the un war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia. the deal to open formal talks with ankara came despite an eu demand for turkey to recognise cyprus. turkey s involvement with the eu would provide an invaluable bridge between europe and the rest of the world mr howard added.
