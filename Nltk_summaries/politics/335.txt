labour say a lib dem vote could let the tories in , while the tories say the lib dems would mean higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to europe . mr kennedy's tour comes as he, labour leader tony blair and conservative leader michael howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next general election, widely expected to be held on 5 may. stops in shrewsbury, north dorset, liverpool, manchester, basingstoke and west london are planned for later in the week. if you look at the four previous parliamentary by elections, the liberal democrats have demonstrated that, not only can we leapfrog the conservatives where we start in a third place position, but we can go on to defeat the government. the liberal democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and labour, while in southern seats particularly the south west it is between them and the tories.
