kennedy questions trust of blair lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a fundamental lack of trust of tony blair as prime minister. mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than 100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. we don't actually hear the argument any longer 'lib dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here it's a wasted vote'. 1983 was when i was first elected as an mp so tony blair, michael howard and myself were all class of '83 and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition, he said. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered lib dem tax plans, anti terror laws and immigration.
