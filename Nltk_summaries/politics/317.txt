they say they can save 4bn on government waste , of which 1.3bn could be used to cut pensioners' bills by an average of 340. it would not be means tested, say the tories, because that would create more bureaucracy and could discourage people from saving for their retirement. an independent inquiry into its findings, the lyons review, is due to report back at the end of 2005. the tories have promised a reduction on bills for pensioners, who they say have been hardest hit by year on year increases in council tax. instead households where council tax payers are over 65 would get a rebate covering half their bill, up to a maximum of 500. the tories also say they are suspicious about any proposals to revalue homes currently graded according to their value in 1991 because they believe seven million of homes could move up a band. they say they are already helping pensioners with council tax bills, with a 100 lump sum for the over 70s and last year the government capped some local councils' budgets to keep demands down. a report last year looked at increasing the number of council tax bands and other forms of local taxation, such as reformed business rates, although no decisions have been made. parties' plans for council tax anger at council tax rises spilled over into mass protests in 2003, when the average english bill rose 12.9%.
