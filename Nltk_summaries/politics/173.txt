armed robber robert napier, 25, won 2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at barlinnie prison. napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the european convention on human rights, in which he sought 5,000. he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case. judge lord cullen, sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights.
