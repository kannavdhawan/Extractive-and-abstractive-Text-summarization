leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently expanded eu. some are worried that turkey s large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult. some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform.
