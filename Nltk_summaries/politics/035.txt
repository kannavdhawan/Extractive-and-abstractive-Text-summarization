leaders meet over turkish eu bid tony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently expanded eu. some are worried that turkey's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. the key issue at this week's council will be that of turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters.
