how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money, the clean hospitals and good, disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the wrong solution to them. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax. uk heading wrong way, says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed, michael howard has said. mr blair's government was a bossy, interfering government that takes decisions that should be made by individuals, he added. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government, of which he was a member, inflicted upon the country. this is the record mr blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.
