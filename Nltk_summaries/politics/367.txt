uk heading wrong way says howard tony blair has had the chance to tackle the problems facing britain and has failed michael howard has said. how much tax do people want to pay who will give taxpayers value for money the clean hospitals and good disciplined schools they want who can be trusted to get a grip on the disorder on our streets and the chaos in our immigration system mr blair has failed to tackle these problems he claimed saying he has the wrong solution to them. let us never forget that when michael howard was in government britain suffered mass unemployment 15 interest rates record home repossessions and the introduction of the poll tax. rather than alluding to false promises michael howard should be starting 2005 with an apology to the british people for the misery that the government of which he was a member inflicted upon the country. britain is heading in the wrong direction the conservative leader said in his new year message.
