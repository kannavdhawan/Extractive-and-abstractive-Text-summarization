the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. ministers thought merging the prison service with the council controlled criminal justice social work departments which provide community sentences might have provided an answer. the scottish executive will not now merge the scottish prison service with local authority social work criminal justice departments. instead scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending.
