ministers thought merging the prison service with the council controlled criminal justice social work departments, which provide community sentences, might have provided an answer. the minister said better joint working will help prisons play a much stronger role in ending reoffending behaviour and in particular help address the revolving door of reoffending that sees offenders entering prison for short periods during which little is done to address the behaviour that brought them there. therefore, as we continue to invest in the service, it is only right that we seek to ensure that that service becomes more accountable to the public it serves, to ministers and to parliament. instead, scottish councils and the prison service will be compelled to work more closely to cut reoffending. the plan was to ensure offenders were monitored by the same body during and after prison, preventing many from being lost in the system and helping more of them to stop reoffending. she will announce the move in her criminal justice plan on monday, aiming to break down the barriers between what happens in prison and what happens in the community .
