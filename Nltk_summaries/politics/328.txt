on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, tory mp michael mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry, told the bbc that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule. he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman, two of his own officials, three foreign office officials, a qc, christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor, lord irvine of lairg. another peer meanwhile, lord skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction . as i have always made clear, i set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing un security council resolutions, he said. last week lord goldsmith said in a statement i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer. the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did, he said.
