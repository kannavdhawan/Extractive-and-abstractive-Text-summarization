the making decisions alliance, which includes the alzheimer's society, age concern, mencap and the national autistic society, said misunderstandings over the bill had to be cleared up. the bill would give legal force to living wills , where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated. we are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law, he said. the christian medical fellowship cmf and lawyers' christian fellowship lcf said the mental capacity bill would allow euthanasia by the back door . it will not change the current law on euthanasia and will actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity, the alliance said in a statement.
