police chief backs drinking move a chief constable has backed the introduction of 24 drinking, saying police had a responsibility to ensure people could benefit from a law change. however, he believes a lot of preparatory work is still needed to be done by police, local authorities and the drinks industry before the nation was ready for 24 hour drinking. however, mr hayman said it would be totally unacceptable in my view for a chief constable to say, 'i'm very sorry'. the metropolitan police chief said last week that the plans for 24 hour drinking should be re examined because of a binge drinking epidemic . andy hayman said he did not agree with politicians and senior police officers who have objected to the plans, which come into force on 7 february. however, norfolk police chief andy hayman also warned that a great deal of preparatory work was still needed.
