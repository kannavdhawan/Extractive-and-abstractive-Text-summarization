up to now, ministers have held back from final removal orders against unaccompanied children until after they are legally adults at 18. at least a dozen albanian born teenagers are thought to have been identified for return, according to sources, although there is no public confirmation of numbers. the medical foundation has many serious concerns, including the assessment process for suitability for return, the degrading of best interests of the child principles and of child welfare, and the lack of safeguards in the chosen countries. the pilot, included in the government's five year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum seeking children from albania who have failed in their asylum claims. we do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the uk indefinitely separated from their families and communities. in its five year immigration plan, announced on tuesday, the government said it was addressing the difficult issue of returning unaccompanied asylum seeking children. from what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account, said mr hogg.
