the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in. in the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row. but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other, an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms, results in arms levels that are too high. the result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off. in the case of the labour party, if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest, solomon's wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem. clearly the prisoners' best strategy is to keep their mouths shut, and take the short sentence, but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk.
