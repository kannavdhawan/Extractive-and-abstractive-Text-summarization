mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games. according to robert walsh head of brisbane based game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between 10 25m to make with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. mr batter predicted that by 2006 mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony s upcoming psp handheld console. mobile games are a fast growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games. new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told.
