the first new console, microsoft's xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today. according to robert walsh, head of brisbane based game developer krome studios, next generation games will cost between 10 25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. its latest tool, gencrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. in a pre recorded video slot during microsoft's keynote address at the game developers conference, held last week in san francisco, famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita. if you're a start up, i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for 10m, however good you are, he said.
