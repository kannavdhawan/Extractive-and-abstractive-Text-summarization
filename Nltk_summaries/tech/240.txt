viewers in japan, the us, australia, canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound. the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming, says andy quested, from the bbc's high definition support group. many high end european tv programmes, such as the recent athens olympics, are already being produced in high definition. according to consultants strategy analytics, only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high definition by 2008. but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. hdtv is just the latest must have technology in viewers' homes, says jo flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us.
