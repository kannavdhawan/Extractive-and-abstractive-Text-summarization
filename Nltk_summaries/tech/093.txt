the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. the relentless pace of development in the hi tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year.
