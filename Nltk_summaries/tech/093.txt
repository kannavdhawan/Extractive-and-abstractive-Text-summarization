the 3 network launched in 2003, vodafone launched its consumer service in november, orange followed in early december and t mobile and o2 are due to launch in 2005. the main result of these launches will likely be a slew of good deals for consumers as operators try to poach new customers from rivals and convince existing users to trade up. the relentless pace of development in the hi tech world and rampant competition in many of its sectors, particularly among mobile phone firms, all suggests that 2005 is going to be a very good year. bob larribeau, principal analyst at telecom view, said the better return on investment offered by technologies such as wimax could dent the possible returns of 3g networks. anyone with a broadband connection, which is now more than 50% of the uk's net using population, can use voip and could slash their monthly phone bills if they used it. show me an operator that believes their voice business can sustain them, and i'll write their obituary said niel ransom, chief technology officer at alcatel.
