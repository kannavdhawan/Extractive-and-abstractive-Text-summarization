tony macklin, director of product at ask jeeves, pointed out that its search engine has been answering specific queries this way since april 2003. the major search providers have moved beyond delivering only algorithmic search, so in many ways microsoft is following the market, he said. this renewed interest has come about because of the realisation that many of the things people do online begin with a search for information be it for a particular web page, recipe, book, gadget, news story, image or anything else. for its direct answer feature, microsoft is calling on its encarta encyclopaedia to provide answers to questions about definitions, facts, calculations, conversions and solutions to equations. the now formally launched msn search site takes the training wheels off the test version unveiled in november 2003. the revamped engine indexes more pages than before, can give direct answers to factual questions, and features tools to help people create detailed queries. but in the last year google has faced greater competition than ever for users as old rivals, such as yahoo and microsoft, and new entrants such as amazon and blinkx, try to grab some of the searching audience for themselves.
