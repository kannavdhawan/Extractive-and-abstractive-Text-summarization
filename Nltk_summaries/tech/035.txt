they accused mr sigarchi of a string of crimes against iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of iran's islamic republic, ayatollah ruhollah khomenei, and current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei. a spokesman for reporters without borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described mr sigarchi's sentence as harsh and called on iranian president mohammed khatami to work to secure his immediate release. a second iranian blogger, motjaba saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held. his sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog reporters without borders, comes a day after an online day of action to secure his release. mr sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the gilan area. the eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on iran since sigarchi's sentence, not less.
