instead local pc makers like lenovo group in china and aquarius in russia that can better tailor the pc form factor, price point and applications to their local markets will ultimately win the market share battle, he said. today's products from western pc vendors won't dominate in those markets in the long term, simon yates, a senior analyst for forrester, said. more than a third of all new pcs will be in these markets, with china adding 178 million new pcs by 2010, it said. the report comes less than a week after ibm, a pioneer of the pc business, sold its pc hardware division to china's number one computer maker lenovo. the united states, europe and asia pacific are expected to add 150 million new pcs by 2010, according to the study.
