china net cafe culture crackdown chinese authorities closed 12 575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the country s government said. chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes. laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines.
