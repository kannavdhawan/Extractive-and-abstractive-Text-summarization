the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas, comprising three major cities los santos, which is a thinly disguised los angeles, san fierro, aka san francisco and las venturas, a carbon copy of las vegas. at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, san andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro censorship brigade. instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the driv3r and true crime shaped opposition. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the game's overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous. this title, incidentally, is set in 1992, but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists.
