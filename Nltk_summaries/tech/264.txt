another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt s reach meaning more than 95 of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than 20 at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market. by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds. broadband soars in 2004 if broadband were a jumbo jet then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off. with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like.
