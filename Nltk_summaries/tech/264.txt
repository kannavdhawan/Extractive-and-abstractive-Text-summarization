another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived. broadband soars in 2004 if broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take off. in may, bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so called local loop unbundling. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than 20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market. broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees.
