so, for instance a whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. artgarden, developed by bt's research unit, is being tested by the tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. smart search lets art fans browse if you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. for richard tateson, who worked on the artgarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. it is much more akin to wandering through the gallery, said jemima rellie, head of the tate's digital programme. similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object.
