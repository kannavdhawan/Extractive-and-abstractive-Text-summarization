the attorney general alleges that messages sent by mr pitylak and mr trotter's companies broke the 2003 controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act can spam as well as the texas electronic mail and solicitation act and texas deceptive trade practices act. in particular, the pornographic messages did not identify themselves as being sexually explicit, had deceptive subject headings, did not have working opt out mechanisms, failed to mention they were adverts and did not give the sender's real world address. leadplex and payperaction are legitimate internet marketing companies that are in complete compliance with the federal can spam act, said lin hughes, speaking on behalf of mr pitylak and mr trotter. the texas attorney general said it started the legal action as messages sent by the alleged spammers broke three laws governing e mail marketing. illegal spam must be stopped, said greg abbott, texas attorney general announcing the legal action.
