by creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. why cell will get the hard sell the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your tv, for example. the cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump start to the fully digital home of the future. both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as pcs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack.
