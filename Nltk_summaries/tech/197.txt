the file, nicknamed skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee 222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson, motorola, benq, arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program. once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone.
