the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. victor wong, a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. blind student 'hears in colour' a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work. mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a colour memory makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. for the sake of my own study and for the sake of blind scientists generally i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images.
