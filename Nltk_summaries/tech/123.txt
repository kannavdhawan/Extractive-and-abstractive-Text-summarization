attack prompts bush site block the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons . mike prettejohn, netcraft president, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run up to the election on 2 november. there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney have failed. the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it.
