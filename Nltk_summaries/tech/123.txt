attack prompts bush site block the official re election site of president george w bush is blocking visits from overseas users for security reasons . there are now at least three working alternative domains for the bush cheney campaign that let web users outside the us visit the site. the blocking began early on monday so those outside the us and trying to view the site got a message saying they are not authorised to view it. data gathered by netcraft on the pattern of traffic to the site shows that the blocking is not the result of another denial of service attack. managing traffic could also be a good way to ensure that the site stays working in the closing days of the election campaign.
