creator of first apple mac dies jef raskin, head of the team behind the first macintosh computer, has died. his role on the macintosh was the initiator of the project, so it wouldn't be here if it weren't for him, said andy hertzfeld, an early macintosh team member. however, in 1979 he was put in charge of a small team to design a computer that lived up to his idea of a machine that was cheap, aimed at consumers rather than computer professionals and was very easy to use. the macintosh was reputedly named after mr raskin's favourite apple, though the name was changed slightly following a trademark dispute with another company. after leaving apple, mr raskin founded another company called information appliance and continued to work on better ways to interface with computers. mr raskin joined apple in 1978 as employee number 31, initially to lead the company's publications department.
