for your money you get a 1.8ghz amd sempron processor, 512mb of ram, 120gb hard drive, dvd writer, 16 inch monitor, mouse, keyboard and windows xp2 much more than the basics. the machine comes with mac os x, the apple operating system, the software suite ilife, which includes itunes, iphoto, imovie, idvd and garageband. a surprisingly good pc sporting an amd athlon xp 2500 processor, 512 megabytes ram, a graphics card with 128 ram on board plus tv out, a 40 gb hard drive, cd writer and dvd player, windows xp home. performance wise, it's not 'cutting edge' and is barely entry level by today's market, but up against the mac mini, i believe it will hold its own and even pull a few more tricks, says gavin cox. apple offer a less powerful mac mini for 339 but the 399 models has a 1.4ghz power pc chip, 80 gigabyte hard drive, combined cd burner dvd player. a 2.6ghz intel celeron chip, 40 gigabyte hard drive, 256mb, combined cd burner dvd player.
