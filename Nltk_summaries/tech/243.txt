according to pc pro, producing a print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs 1.87. at jessops the same image would cost 2.50 and at snappy snaps 9.99. a 10x7in snap at boots would cost 4.99. considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home, he said. if you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer, said nick ross, top tester at pc pro.
