in a letter, ec president jos manuel barroso told the president of the european parliament, josep borrell, that the commission did not intend to refer a new proposal to the parliament and the council of ministers as it had supported the agreement reached by ministers in may 2004. if the european council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the european parliament. some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms the ec says the council of ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last may but said it would review all aspects of the directive . 'no re draft' for eu patent law a proposed european law on software patents will not be re drafted by the european commission ec despite requests by meps. this, they fear, could hurt small software developers because they do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies if they had to fight patent legal action in court. the directive is intended to offer patent protection to inventions that use software to achieve their effect, in other words, computer implemented invention . he said that the parliament would then reject the council's version of the legislation as part of the final or conciliation stage of the decision procedure.
