some design crimes, such as splash screens that get between a user and the site they are trying to visit, and web designers indulging their artistic urges have almost disappeared, said dr nielsen. but, says usability guru dr jakob nielsen, some things have stayed constant in that decade, namely the principles of what makes a site easy to use. dr nielsen said the basic principles of usability, centring around ease of use and clear thinking about a site's total design, were as important as ever. dr nielsen said the success of sites such as google, amazon, ebay and yahoo showed that close attention to design and user needs was important. back in 1994, yahoo had only just launched, most websites were text based and amazon, google and ebay had yet to appear. those four sites are extremely profitable and extremely successful, said dr nielsen, adding that they have largely defined commercial success on the net.
