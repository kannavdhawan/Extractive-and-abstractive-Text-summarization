incidents like this happen, said mr thiemann, because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. todd thiemann, spokesman for anti virus firm trend micro, said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. for many years the venerable ibm operating system, known as os 2, has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them. the many different security systems built in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said. he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay, mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data.
