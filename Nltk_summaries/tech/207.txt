data can disappear as a result of natural disaster, system fault or computer virus, but human error, including 'computer rage', seems to be a growing problem, said adrian palmer, managing director of ontrack data recovery. although computer malfunctions remain the most common cause of file loss, data recovery experts say human behaviour still is to blame in many cases. data can be recovered from computers, servers and even memory cards used in digital devices in most cases, said mr palmer. mr palmer recalled the case of a couple who had hundreds of pictures of their baby's first three months on their computer, but managed to reformat the hard drive and erase all the precious memories. careless and preventable mistakes that result in data loss range from reckless file maintenance practices to episodes of pure rage towards a computer.
