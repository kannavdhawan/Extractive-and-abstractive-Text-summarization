former virus writer marek strihavka, aka benny from the 29a virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. as the tactics used by malicious programs change, said mr king, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. not least, said paul king, principal security consultant at cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. few of the malicious programs written by hi tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to, said pete simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift.
