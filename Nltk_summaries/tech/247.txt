nintendo adds media playing to ds nintendo is releasing an adapter for its ds handheld console so it can play music and video. the launch of the media adapter, and the attempt to broaden the appeal of the device, is widely seen as a response to the unveiling of the sony psp which was built as a multi purpose media player and game gadget from the start. the dual screen ds is also thought to be selling well with more than 2.5 million expected to be sold by the end of 2004. nintendo said it had no plans to sell the media adapter outside japan. the ds has two screens, one of which is touch sensitive, and also has on board a short range wireless link that lets people play against each other. when it goes on sale the adapter is expected to cost about 5000 yen 25 , roughly the difference in price between the ds and the higher priced sony psp.
