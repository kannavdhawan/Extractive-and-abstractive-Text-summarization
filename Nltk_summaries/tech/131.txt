if you're issued a seafarer's id in your country, you want to be sure that when the ship lands in a port in, say, my country you can validate yourself using whatever equipment we have installed, authenti corp's ceo, cynthia musselman, told the bbc's go digital programme. the cards are due to be issued in february next year, in line with the revised un convention on seafarers' identity documents of june 2003. tests currently under way in the caribbean are designed to ensure that new cards and their machine readers, produced by different companies in different countries, are working to interoperable standards. as holidaymakers enjoy balmy breezes, their ship's crew is testing prototype versions of the world's first internationally issued biometric id cards, the seafarer's equivalent of a passport. the convention highlights the importance of access to shore facilities and shore leave as vital elements to a sailor's wellbeing and, therefore, it says, to safer shipping and cleaner oceans. it should be a safer environment for seafarers to work in, and will allow people protecting their borders to have confidence that the people getting off the ship are, in fact, seafarers. along with the owner's picture, name and personal details, the new seafarers' identity document incorporates a barcode representing unique features of its holder's fingerprints.
