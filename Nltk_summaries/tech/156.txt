dr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer to peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file sharing systems. but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file sharing systems. org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file swapping network dubbed exeem. users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.
