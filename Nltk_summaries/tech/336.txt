the mac mini comes bundled with mac os x, the operating system, as well as ilife 05, a suite of software which includes itunes, web browser safari, iphoto, garage band and idvd. but does the latest macintosh justify the hype let us get a few things dealt with at the outset yes, the mac mini is really, really small, and yes, it is another piece of inspired apple design. it's just a mac, but we should be very excited it's revolutionary in its size smaller than pcs , looks looks better than pcs , and the fact that it's the first mac designed to really go for the low cost pc market. when it was first announced some pundits thought the mini was designed as a sort of stealth media centre ie the machine would be used to serve tv programmes, music, films and photos partly due to its small, living room friendly design. so is the mac mini just another computer or a revolution in computing graham barlow, editor of mac format, understandably has a rather partisan viewpoint. coupled with the lack of a tv tuner card, a digital audio out and any kind of media centre software bundled with the machine then the mac mini should be judged on what it is, not what it is not.
