christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone. also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct, said andrew bud, regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting.
