one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006. basically, visual radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before. if you have a visual radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you've just been listening to.
