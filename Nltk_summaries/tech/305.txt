one thing that is for sure assuming that nokia retains its market share in handsets, it is estimating that there will be 100 million visual radio enabled mobile phones in circulation by the end of 2006. basically, visual radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before. if you have a visual radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on air broadcast you've just been listening to. one problem is that the name visual radio leads people to think of television but reidar wasenius, a senior project manager at nokia, was adamant that visual radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium. finnish handset giant nokia has been working on a technology called visual radio, which takes an existing fm signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures. games, cameras and music players have all been added to our handsets in the last few years, but 2005 could see another big innovation that won't just see a change in our mobile phone habits it might alter the way we listen to the radio.
