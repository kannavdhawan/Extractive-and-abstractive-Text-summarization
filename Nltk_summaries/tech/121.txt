showing off its skills at the science museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds, professor dautenhahn told bbc news online. the research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists, said professor kerstin dautenhahn, project leader at hertfordshire. however, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the robotiquette for human interaction.
