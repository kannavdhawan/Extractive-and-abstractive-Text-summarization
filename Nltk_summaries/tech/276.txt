you can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it, he said, referring to demand for titles for such as grand theft auto san andreas and halo 2. jan bolz, ea's vice president of sales and marketing in europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture. one idea could be that you're controlling a family, telling them when to go to the kitchen and when to go to the bedroom, and with this mechanism you have gamers all over the world 'playing the show', said mr bolz. mr florin said that more than 50% of all ea's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children. gerhard florin, ea's managing director for european publishing, said doubling our industry in five years is not rocket science. its revenues were 3bn 1.65bn in 2004, which ea hoped to double by 2009. ea is the biggest games publisher in the world and in 2004 had 27 titles which sold in excess of one million copies each. he also said ea was planning an international awards show similar to the oscars and the grammys which would combine video games, music and movies.
