after all why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want whenever i want streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts something which ensures that it is always in someone s pocket or handbag available for other uses too. by contrast the confusing menus complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max s 3g phone simply get in the way and i did not see much value in the paid for services especially the limited web access. i have never really approved of using the internet protocol ip to do either audio or video streaming and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using voice over ip . i bought my son max a 3g phone partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life. with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service and 3 already established in the uk video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress.
