after all, why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want, whenever i want, streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts, something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag, available for other uses too. by contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max's 3g phone simply get in the way, and i did not see much value in the paid for services, especially the limited web access. with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service, and 3 already established in the uk, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. it is easy to be dismissive of small screens, and indeed anyone of my generation, with failing eyesight and the view that 'there's never anything worth watching on tv', is hardly going to embrace these phones. the videos of entertainment news, horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal, and i did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image, never mind micro tv.
