after all, why should i want to carry 60gb of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when i can simply listen to anything i want, whenever i want, streamed to my phone oh and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts, something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag, available for other uses too. by contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max's 3g phone simply get in the way, and i did not see much value in the paid for services, especially the limited web access.
