in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play. but with this, valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half life 2, he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half life 2, read the statement. before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.
