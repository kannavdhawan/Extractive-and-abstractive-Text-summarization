the labs, set up in an old guinness brewery, housed around 100 people, made up of staff, researchers, students, collaborators and part time undergraduate students. in the end, it was too deep and too long a recession, said simon jones, the labs' managing director. many concepts fed into science, engineering, and psychology as well as technology, but it is thought too few of the ideas were commercially viable in the near term. since its opening in 2000, the centre has developed ideas, such as implants for teeth, and also aimed to be a digital hub for start ups in the area. other projects looked at using other human senses, like touch, to interact with devoices which could be embedded in the environment, or on the body itself. the human connectedness group, for example, developed the iband, a bracelet which stored and exchanged information about you and your relationships.
