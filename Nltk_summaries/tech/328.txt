we discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier, said tim danton, editor of pc pro. it is particularly bad news for bt, the uk's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining. we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch, he said. a third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton, editor of pc pro magazine. this breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or ofcom can do to help, he said.
