latest opera browser gets vocal net browser opera 8.0 due for official release at the end of next month will be the most accessible browser on the market according to its authors. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. unlike commercially available voice recognition software opera does not have to be trained to recognise an individual voice. another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling. the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud.
