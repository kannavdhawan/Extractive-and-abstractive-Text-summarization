players must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen filling bosses that guard each of the five levels. and at a mere 20, metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon toting camels, elephants and ostriches more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. 2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past, metal slug 3 is a wake up call to today's gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings.
