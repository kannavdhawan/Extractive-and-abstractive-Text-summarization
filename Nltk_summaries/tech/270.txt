many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said mr king. maria capella, spokeswoman for net provider pipex, said that when ddos attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. malcolm seagrave, security expert at energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. net firms are realising that it's not just about anti virus and firewalls, said paul king, chief security architect at cisco. you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another, said mr seagrave. we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack, said ms capella.
