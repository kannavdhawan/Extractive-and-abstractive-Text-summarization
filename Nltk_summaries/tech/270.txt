many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king. malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. mr king said the only way to properly combat these so called distributed denial of service attacks was with intelligent net based systems. maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days. we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave.
