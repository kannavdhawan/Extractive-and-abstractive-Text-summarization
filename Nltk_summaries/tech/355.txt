apple makes blogs reveal sources apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products. apple s lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage apple insider and think secret websites. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg apple can now get its hands on e mail records from the bloggers net providers. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent. judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists too.
