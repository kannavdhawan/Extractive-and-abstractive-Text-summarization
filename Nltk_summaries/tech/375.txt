more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities helsinki, oslo, munich, paris, stockholm, copenhagen, chicago and sydney where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. this has left londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec, a mobile data backup firm. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. in london alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers.
