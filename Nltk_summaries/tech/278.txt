the vast majority of pictures remain on a pc's hard drive, which is why search tools, such as those offered by google, become increasingly important. marcus hawkins, editor of digital camera magazine, said as file sizes of pictures increase, storage becomes a problem. some services, such as kodak's ofoto and snapfish, offer unlimited storage space but they do require users to buy some prints online. it's one thing taking pictures, it's another finding them, said mr hawkins. photo giants such as kodak offer website storage which manages photo collections, lets users edit pictures online and provides print ordering services.
