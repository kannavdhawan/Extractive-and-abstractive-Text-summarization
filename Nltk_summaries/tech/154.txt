no half measures with half life 2 could half life 2 possibly live up to the hype after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it s safe to say that this is the most highly anticipated computer game of all time. at times half life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to and in a curious way its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top notch theme park thrill ride wandering through half life s world truly does feel like being part of a movie. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances but luckily half life 2 is up to the challenge. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half life.
