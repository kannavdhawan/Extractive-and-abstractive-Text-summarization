now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on. his creator, richard bowden, lecturer at the centre for vision, speech and signal processing at the university of surrey, refers to jeremiah as him , rather than it. if you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea, said dr bowden. but when jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching. i am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that, explained dr bowden. experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos.
