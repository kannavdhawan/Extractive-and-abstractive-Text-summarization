but what do we do with the old ones i've just looked around my office and i find two monitors, an old 386 pc, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents. we're seeing the same thing in the technology industry and, as a result, there are billions of devices, from old mobile phones to antique handhelds, that will have to be recycled in years to come. here in cambridge we have green bins for compostable waste, a box for glass, cans and paper that can be recycled, and a black bin for the rest. the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder, a phenomenon called 'knocking', so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. i could take them up the to the council recycling centre, but it's a 10 mile drive away across town, and like many other people my commitment to recycling is shallow at best.
