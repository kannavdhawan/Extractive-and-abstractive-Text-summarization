but what do we do with the old ones i ve just looked around my office and i find two monitors an old 386 pc two old handhelds three ancient laptops four antique mobile phones a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. the car engine is a case in point lead additives helped stop petrol vapour exploding too early in the cylinder a phenomenon called knocking so they were simply used without any real thought for the fact that the lead would end up in the atmosphere. chip giant intel recently began shipping computer circuit boards that are lead free too reflecting a growing awareness on the part of the technology industry that products have to be designed and built in more environmentally friendly ways. would it be too much to ask for an electronics recycling box too i d probably remember to take my old mobile with me to the supermarket and drop it in a box at least eventually. apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic mercury cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents.
