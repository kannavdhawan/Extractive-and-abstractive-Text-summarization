but what do we do with the old ones i've just looked around my office and i find two monitors, an old 386 pc, two old handhelds, three ancient laptops, four antique mobile phones, a collection of rechargeable batteries and even a sun workstation that is no longer really much use. apart from reducing the use of toxic materials like arsenic, mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals in the products themselves, the manufacturing process is also being cleaned up, with fewer complex and potentially damaging organic chemicals used as solvents.
