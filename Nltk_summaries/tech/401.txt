i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning... as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. i think i m obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to i m always thinking in the back if my mind that i d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united. losing yourself in online gaming online role playing games are time consuming but enthralling flights from reality. so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them. can you reccomend a counsellor this is not a wind up... but something i m increasingly concerned with... me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual.
