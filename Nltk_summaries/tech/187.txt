senior consultants from eds, the computer firm which manage the system, and microsoft, which supplied the software, were running around trying to figure out what had to be done to fix it all, while staff resorted to phone, fax and probably carrier pigeon to get work done. so why did not the prime minister's official spokesman mention it at any lobby briefings before friday why was not the pensions minister in parliament to make an emergency statement on tuesday, when it was clear that there was a serious problem if there had been an outbreak of legionnaire's disease in the air conditioning system we would have been told, but it seems that major technology problems do not merit the same treatment. and the most important is that in this digital world, technology failures are matters of public interest, not something that can be ignored in the hope that nobody will notice, care or understand. although the full story has not yet been told, it seems that the problem started when a plan to upgrade some of the computers from windows 2000 to windows xp went wrong, and xp code was inadvertently copied to thousands of machines across the network. it is, without a doubt, a major story and was the second or third lead item on bbc radio 4's today programme throughout friday morning. what is really disturbing, and cannot be excused, is the fact that it took four days for news of this systems failure to leak out into the technical press.
