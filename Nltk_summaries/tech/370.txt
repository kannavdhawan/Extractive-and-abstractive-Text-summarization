the electronic frontier foundation, a civil rights watchdog, is also defending streamcast networks, the company behind the morpheus file sharing software. asking firms to second guess the uses that its technologies would be put to, and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs, file sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software, government documents and promotional copies of music. but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus the file sharers at the centre of the case are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file sharing providers. supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple's ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had, on balance, been beneficial to society. the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past 20 years, said gary shapiro, chief executive of the consumer electronics association.
