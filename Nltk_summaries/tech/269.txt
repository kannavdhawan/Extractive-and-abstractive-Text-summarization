yahoo moves into desktop search internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e mail and other files on their pcs. it doesn t yet incorporate web searching although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web based and desktop data. it is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well he said. more useful would be tools that can combine internet intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching he said. we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content said julian smith an analyst with research firm jupiter.
