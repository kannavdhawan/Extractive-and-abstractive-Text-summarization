the committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non for profit organisation. i hope this day will focus people, curt hopkins, director of the committee, told the bbc news website. if you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'free mojtaba and arash day', said mr hopkins. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech. everyone does this mums, radicals, conservatives, he said. but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said mr hopkins, is part of the whole messy conversation.
