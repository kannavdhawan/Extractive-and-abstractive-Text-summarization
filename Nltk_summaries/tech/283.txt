for instance, he said, in a version of the sims adapted to teach german, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word energie the actions of a tired sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. however, online versions of the sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. the hard part of learning any language, said mr purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. by contrast, said mr purushotma, learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. but, he said, using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. a report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.
