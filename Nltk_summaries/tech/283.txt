the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore said mr purushotma. the hard part of learning any language said mr purushotma were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. by contrast said mr purushotma learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. but he said using pre prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. a report on the experiment said students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play using geography and history as tools for their game and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.
