the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language. the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid , but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets. video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language bsl could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter. mr currington, like many of the uk's 70,000 bsl users, will be hoping that a way can be found to make a cost effective service available. there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people, said rnid technology director, guido gybels.
