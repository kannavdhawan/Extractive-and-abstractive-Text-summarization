the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone, and the interpreter then relays the deaf person's conversation using a telephone and translates the other person's response into sign language. the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid , but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most people's pockets.
