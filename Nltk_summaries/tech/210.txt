the bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the mydoom bug, can infect machines running windows 2000, 95, 98, me, nt, xp and server 2003. users running windows xp that have applied the sp2 update are not vulnerable to the loophole that bofra exploits. the virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail.
