halo 2 heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company sandvine. it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo 2. the 9 november traffic explosion has continued into december, said sandvine. as well as being a popular single player title, halo 2 can be connected to microsoft's subscription based broadband network, xbox live. but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said sandvine's chief technology officer marc morin. in the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live play gaming, she said.
