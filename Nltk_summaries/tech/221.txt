halo 2 heralds traffic explosion the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms warns network monitoring company sandvine. it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo 2. the 9 november traffic explosion has continued into december said sandvine. but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic said sandvine s chief technology officer marc morin. analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth hungry gamers said lindsay schroth an analyst with research firm the yankee group. one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is lag in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world.
