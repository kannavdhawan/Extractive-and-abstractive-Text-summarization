in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past, said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. it's not a two horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight horse race mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again the ipod version, the auto version, the american and uk version, the ringtone version, and so on. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over consumers.
