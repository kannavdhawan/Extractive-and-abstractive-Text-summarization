siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10. siemens in collaboration with the fraunhofer german sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa high speed downlink packet access , a high speed, high bandwidth technology available now. as part of 3bn in multi year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around 1bn on ev do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3 0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide area networks, said dr alastair brydon, author of the analysys report pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second much faster than 3g.
