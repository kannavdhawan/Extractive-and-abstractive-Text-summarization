the detailed look at zombie or 'bot nets of hijacked computers was done by the honeynet project a group of security researchers that gather information using networks of computers that act as honey pots to attract hackers and gather information about how they work. criminals also seem to be starting to use 'bot nets for mass identity theft, to host websites that look like those of banks so confidential information can be gathered and to peep into online traffic to steal sensitive data. during the monitoring period, the team saw 'bot nets used to launch 226 distributed denial of service attacks on 99 separate targets. the research found that, once compromised machines tend to report in to chat channels on irc servers and wait instructions from the malicious hacker behind the tools used to recruit the machine. the months of surveillance revealed that the different 'bot nets which involve a few hundred to tens of thousands of machines are used for a variety of purposes.
