john underwood the man behind the live shot website said the idea for the remote control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133 hectare texas ranch. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals. mike berger wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. mr underwood said that internet hunting could be popular with disabled hunters unable to get out in the woods or distant hunters who cannot afford a trip to texas.
