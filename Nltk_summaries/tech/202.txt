john underwood, the man behind the live shot website, said the idea for the remote control hunting came to him a year ago when he was watching deer via a webcam on another net site. mike berger, wildlife director of the texas parks and wildlife department, said current hunting statutes did not cover net or remote hunting. we assume it would be extremely difficult to accurately control a gun in this way and therefore it would be difficult to ensure a 'clean kill', something the rspca accepts is the intention of those shooting for sport, it said. a texas company is considering letting web users use a remote controlled rifle to shoot down deer, antelope and wild pigs. for a small fee users will take control of a camera and rifle that they can use to spot and shoot the game animals as they roam around a 133 hectare texas ranch. mr underwood is planning to put one of these rigs in a concealed location in a small reserve on his texas ranch and let people shoot at a variety of game animals.
