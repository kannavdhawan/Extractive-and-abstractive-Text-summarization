both began life as search engines although in 2000, when yahoo chose google to power its search facility while it concentrated on its web portal business, it was very much yahoo that commanded press attention. yahoo was busy building a portal and while it was good to diversify they made a big mistake in outsourcing search to google, he said they thought google would just be a technology provider but it has become a portal in its own right and a direct competitor, he added. nick hazel, yahoo's head of consumer services in the uk, thinks the fact that yahoo has grown up with the first wave of the internet generation will stand it in good stead. so as the internet giant emerges from its first decade as a survivor, how will it fare as it enters its teenage years the game is theirs to lose and msn is the only one that stands in the way of yahoo's domination, predicted mr weiner. but for allen weiner, a research director at analyst firm gartner and someone who has followed yahoo's progress since the early years, the future of search is not going to be purely about the technology powering it.
