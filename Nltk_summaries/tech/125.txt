geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. there are also the dusty, sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis, as well as the forest moon of endor, where return of the jedi's much maligned ewoks lived. the sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil. there are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear.
