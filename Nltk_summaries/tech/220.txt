music, images, e mails, and texts are being hoarded on mobiles, cameras laptops and pdas personal digital assistants , a toshiba study found. people are looking for more than just phone calls and text messages on the move, they want things like web browsing, e mailing, music, photos and more. the survey reflects the increasing trend for portable devices with built in hard drives like music and media players from apple, creative labs, archos, iriver and others. they suggest the number of hard drives in consumer electronics gadgets could grow from 17 million last year to 55 million in 2006. consumers are driving the move towards smaller devices that have greater functionality, and industry is trying to keep up, said mr larsson. floppies and memory keys have their place, but they don't have anything like the capacity or flexibility of a hard drive so are unable to meet the demand for more and more storage capacity in consumer devices, said mr larsson.
