screensaver tackles spam websites net users are getting the chance to fight back against spam websites internet portal lycos has made a screensaver that endlessly requests data from sites that sell the goods and services mentioned in spam e mail. as these sites rarely use advertising to offset hosting costs, the burden of high bandwidth bills could make spam too expensive, said mr pollmann. we've never really solved the big problem of spam which is that its so damn cheap and easy to do, said malte pollmann, spokesman for lycos europe. but, he said, if enough people sign up spamming websites could be force to pay for gigabytes of traffic every single day. in the past we have built up the spam filtering systems for our users, he said, but now we are going to go one step further.
