last year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the windows based creative zen portable media player, the samsung yepp, the iriver pmc 100, and the archos av400 series among others. but the ability to record directly from tv, vcr, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which windows based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too. unlike windows based players, the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as tvs, as well as playback. consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access, said henri crohas, chief of archos. this year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media, microsoft's mike coleman told the bbc news website.
