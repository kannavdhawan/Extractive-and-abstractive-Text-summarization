dan gillmor, founder of grassroots media, which supports citizen based media, said the tool was a bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth . but as an end user i would want to know 'can i choose to use this service , 'how much is google being paid ', 'can i substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by google '. it also links to google's map service, if there is an address, or to car firm carfax, if there is a licence plate. in a statement google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. if a user clicks the autolink feature in the google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique isbn number would link directly to amazon's website.
