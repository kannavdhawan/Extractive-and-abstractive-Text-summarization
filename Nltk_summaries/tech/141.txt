since the first supercomputer, the cray 1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory, us, in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times. next year with the final blue gene, four times what it is this year, it is going to be a real step up and will be hard to beat, said erich strohmaier, one of the co founders of the top500 list. the defeated japanese contender, the earth simulator, which was listed in third place, losing the top spot it had held since june 2002. it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity. the previous top machine, japan's nec earth simulator, clocked up 35.86. the top 500 list was announced on monday and officially charts the fastest computers in the world. it will help scientists work out the safety, security and reliability requirements for the us's nuclear weapons stockpile, without the need for underground nuclear testing.
