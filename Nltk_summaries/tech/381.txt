it's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult. we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working.
