nokia make 200 million cell phones a year so for us to claim we re going to make 200 million laptops is a big number but we re not talking about doing it in three or five years we re talking about months. digital guru floats sub 100 pc nicholas negroponte chairman and founder of mit s media labs says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than 100 53 . that s for five or six years so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that s cheaper and the marketing overheads go away. he described the device as a stripped down laptop which would run a linux based operating system we have to get the display down to below 20 to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel. however mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops.
