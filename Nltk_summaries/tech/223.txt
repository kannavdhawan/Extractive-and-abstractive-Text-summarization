you have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps, said stefan voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the german aerospace centre. respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large scale maps useful for very general planning purposes, said einar bjorgo from unosat, the un satellite mapping organisation that is part of the respond consortium. our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently, said mr voigt. these wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground, says stephen candillon of respond imaging partner sertit. we print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected. you need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on.
