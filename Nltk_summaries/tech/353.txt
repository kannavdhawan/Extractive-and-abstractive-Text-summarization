ibm said it would partner up with a small uk based electronics firm, montrose secam, to produce the devices which will cost about 70. james cosgrave, one of the company's directors, said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem, said karen walsh, from the uk national tremor foundation. the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows, he said. the assistive mouse adapter ama is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle, who has parkinson's disease, struggle with mouse control. last year, the office for national statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in britain had a home computer.
