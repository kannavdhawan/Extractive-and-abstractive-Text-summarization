if something like this mean the end of e mail then e mail would have stopped two three years ago, said mr hogan. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing, said mr stanley, but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e mail meltdown. for instance, said mr hogan, filtering out e mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam. steve linford, director of spamhaus, predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's e mail sending infrastructure. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too.
