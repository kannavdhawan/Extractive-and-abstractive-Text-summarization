by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no, goldfinger, hat fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years, and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion. given james bond's healthy pedigree in past games, there is every reason to hope that this is just a blip, a commendable idea that just has not worked, that will be rectified when the character inevitably makes his return. bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans, the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995, but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. shooting enemies from a distance can be tricky, and you will not always know you have picked them off, since dead enemies vanish literally before they have fully hit the floor, and they do so in some woefully uninspiring death animations. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner's similarly titled theme song, the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury, which enables a degree of x ray vision.
