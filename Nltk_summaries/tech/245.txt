bond game fails to shake or stir for gaming fans the word goldeneye evokes excited memories not only of the james bond revival flick of 1995 but also the classic shoot em up that accompanied it and left n64 owners glued to their consoles for many an hour. by far the most satisfying element of the game is seeing old favourites like dr no goldfinger hat fiend oddjob and crazed russian sex beast xenia onatopp resurrected after all these years and with their faces rendered in an impressively recognisable fashion. with a determination to justify its name which is even less convincing than that of tina turner s similarly titled theme song the game literally gives the player a golden eye following an injury which enables a degree of x ray vision. recent bond games like nightfire and everything or nothing were very competent and did a fine job of capturing the sense of flair invention and glamour of the film franchise. adopting that hallowed title somewhat backfires on this new game for it fails to deliver on the promise of its name and struggles to generate the original s massive sense of fun.
