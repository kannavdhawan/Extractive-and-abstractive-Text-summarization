also, said mr trainor, research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop. some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space, said mr trainor, though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing. on a larger scale, said mr trainor, improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient. the focus back then was more on performance and features, said mike trainor, chief mobile technology evangelist for chip giant intel. if we can get close to eight hours that's a place that people see as extraordinarily valuable that's what the industry has to deliver, mr trainor said. some of the improvements in power use come simply because components on chips are shrinking, said mr trainor.
