also said mr trainor research is being done on ways to cut energy consumption on displays currently the biggest power guzzler on a laptop. some new battery chemistries promise to cram more power into the same space said mr trainor though work still needed to be done to get them successfully from the lab to manufacturing. on a larger scale said mr trainor improvements in the way that voltage regulators are made can reduce the amount of power lost as heat and make a notebook more energy efficient. intel has been working with component makers to test energy consumption on all the parts inside a laptop and find ways to make them less power hungry. he was sceptical that fuel cells would develop quick enough to take over from solid batteries even though they have the potential to produce several times more energy than lithium ion power packs.
