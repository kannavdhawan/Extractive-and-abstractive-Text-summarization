new delay hits eu software laws a fresh delay has hit controversial new european union rules which govern computer based inventions. critics say the law would favour large companies over small ones and could impact open source software innovation. the eu says the law would bring europe more in line with how such laws work in the us but this has caused some angry debate amongst critics and supporters. in december poland requested more time to consider the issue because it was concerned that the law could lead to the patenting of pure computer software. critics say a similar model in europe would hurt small software developers which do not have the legal and financial might of larger companies.
