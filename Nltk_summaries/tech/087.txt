as inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan, liberal democrat spokesman on it. in fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. in fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion. at the debate, organised by the internet service providers' association ispa , lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation. huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net.
