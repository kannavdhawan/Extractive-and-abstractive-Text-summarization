nintendo ds makes its euro debut nintendo's ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe. we know that customers want it as soon as it's released and that means the minute, not the day, said robert quinn, game's uk sales director. as well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo's gameboy advance handheld. but nintendo will only have sole control of europe's handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console. the psp uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add ons and also supports short range wireless play.
