they are clearly what we call concept vehicles innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university. dr erel avineri of the centre for transport and society at the university of the west of england in bristol said the design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. both these prototypes will be demonstrated along with other concept vehicles and helper robots at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi japan in march 2005. the models are being positioned as so called personal mobility devices which have few limits. with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population care giving and the military wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual s particular mobility needs. while toyota s prototypes are geared towards mass transport the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.
