both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the toyota stand at the expo 2005 in aichi, japan, in march 2005. the models are being positioned as so called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. they clearly have eye catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the imac and ipod type niche which apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years new, different, hi tech, image conscious products. those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people, dr gillingwater told the bbc news website. they are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production, said dr david gillingwater from the transport studies group at loughborough university. with an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs.
