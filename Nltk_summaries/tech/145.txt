for part of the study, pew internet conducted an online survey of 2,755 musicians, songwriters and music publishers via musician membership organisations between march and april 2004. they ranged from full time, successful musicians to artists struggling to make a living from their music. both successful and struggling musicians were more likely to say that the internet has made it possible for them to make more money from their music, rather than make it harder for them to protect their material from piracy, said ms madden. the study by us researchers, pew internet, suggests musicians do not agree with the tactics adopted by the music industry against file sharing. we looked at more of the independent musicians, rather than the rockstars of this industry but that reflects more accurately the state of the music industry, ms madden told the bbc news website. they are using the internet to gain inspiration, sell it online, tracking royalties, learning about copyright.
