getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36 of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message mms up from 7 in 2003. this is despite the fact that during the same period the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26 increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004 according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold between july and september 2004 a period that according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is seldom strong . the problem they face said shailendra jain head of mms firm adamind is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets. andrew bud executive chairman of messaging firm mblox said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system.
