it's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult. we plan to put a solar panel at the school with the base station, have the e slates charge during the day when the children are in school, then they can take them home at night and continue working. maciej sundra, who designed the user interface for the e slates, says the project's ultimate goal is levelling access to knowledge around the world. it is a pilot project run by eduvision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up to date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e slates.
