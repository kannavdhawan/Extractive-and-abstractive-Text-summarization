the slowly growing mass of unrecycled, discarded phones has now reached 90 million handsets, the equivalent of 9,000 tonnes of waste, estimates james goodman, report author and a senior adviser at the forum for the future. it's an interesting country because it has a really crap fixed line network, said mr goodman, and there's a real desire for people to get mobile phones. we've heard the environmental argument for handing a phone back, said mr goodman, but there's a strong social argument too. georgeta minciu, a romanian part time cleaner, said normally a mobile phone would not be possible on my wages. finding new homes for old phones re using old mobile phones is not just good for the environment, it has social benefits too.
