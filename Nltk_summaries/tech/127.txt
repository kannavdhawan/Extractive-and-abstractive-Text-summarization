for those who like their gadgets to be multi talented, the gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with gps and gprs, that also doubles up as an mp3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must have. with apple's ipod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough ipod minis to go round, predicts oliver irish, editor of gadget magazine stuff. star of the show will be sony's qrio robot, an all singing, all dancing, football playing man machine who can even hold intelligent conversations. the event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as creative, sony and philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable ipod from apple. he probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly sony prize him, said mr irish. demand is huge and apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on ipod minis, said mr irish.
