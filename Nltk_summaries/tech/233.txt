2d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug 3 is a wake up call to today s gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye. and yes that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. with its hand animated sprites and 2d side scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware.
