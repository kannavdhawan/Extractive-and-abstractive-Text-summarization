what high definition will do to dvds first it was the humble home video then it was the dvd and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment high definition. but currently putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high definition films demand. it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high definition dvds in 18 months time. mr dean is confident though i think if they see real hd high definition not some heavily compressed version of it there is such a remarkable difference. in the future we are going to look towards file delivery over ip internet protocol broadband giving a dvd like experience from the set top box to the hard drive says mr dean.
