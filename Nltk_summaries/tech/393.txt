according to pew research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. tony macklin, spokesman for ask jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. said the pew report this finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results. a significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. more than two thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net.
