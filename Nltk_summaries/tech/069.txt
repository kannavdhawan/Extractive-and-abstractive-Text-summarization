 friends fear with lost mobiles people are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back up services on the network itself instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. neither vodafone or t mobile currently offer a free network service for back ups but encourage people to use sim back up devices. it is estimated that 53 of over 65s own a mobile according to intervoice but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. most 15 to 24 year olds 94 and 25 to 34 year olds 92 own at least one. many mobile owners do not bother to make back ups of their contact details and with people changing their phones once a year on average it becomes a problem.
