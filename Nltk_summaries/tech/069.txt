it is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile, according to intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34. most 15 to 24 year olds 94% , and 25 to 34 year olds 92% , own at least one. one in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26% more than the previous year, according to analysts. many mobile owners do not bother to make back ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. mr noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves. neither vodafone or t mobile currently offer a free network service for back ups, but encourage people to use sim back up devices.
