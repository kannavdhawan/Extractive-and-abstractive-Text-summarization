all too often, you will perform a stunning triple somersault, pirouette off a wall, knock out three enemies in one glorious swoop, before plummeting purposefully over a cliff to your doom. gritty return for prince of persia still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's sands of time, the dashing prince of persia is back in warrior within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time. studiously structured though this back story is, everything boils down to old fashioned fantasy gameplay which proves, on the whole, as dependable as it needs to be. ever since the series' then groundbreaking beginnings on the commodore amiga, prince of persia has always been about meticulously animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts. it is on a par with the jaw dropping opening sequence of onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti climax. that said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game.
