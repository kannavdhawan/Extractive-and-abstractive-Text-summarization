the impressive non invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis, said the researchers. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought. four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. the results show that people can learn to use scalp recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions, said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively.
