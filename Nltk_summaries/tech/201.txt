the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park in utah and was made up of 196 separate photographs. he did it all by hand which was an enormous effort and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques it would be feasible to build a larger image said jurgen den hartog one of the tno researchers behind the project. the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge. the huge image of delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the dutch city taken at a fixed spot. following the success of this project and with promises of help from others the tno team is considering creating a full 360 degree panoramic view of another dutch city with even higher resolution.
