he did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image, said jurgen den hartog, one of the tno researchers behind the project. following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the tno team is considering creating a full 360 degree panoramic view of another dutch city, with even higher resolution. the first image of such a size was manually constructed by us photographer max lyons in november 2003. that image portrayed bryce canyon national park, in utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. the dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high resolution image. all standard windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves. the image was created by imaging experts from the dutch research and technology laboratory tno which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.
