it has value, according to ibm, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates. when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster, mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be in your face . pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. as computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage.
