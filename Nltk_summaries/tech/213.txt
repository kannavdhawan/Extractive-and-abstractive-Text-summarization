blinkx is desktop search software that watches what someone is working on, be it a document or e mail, and suggests websites, video clips, blogs or documents on a pc that are relevant to it. since blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as google, copernic, enfish, x1 and apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their pc as well as the web. on average, said mr macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in my ask jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily. the classic thing we have seen recently, is people using blinkx to look at the things they have searched on, he said. the future is all about developing your own personal web, said tony macklin, spokesman for ask jeeves. some of the latest to update their search systems are ask jeeves and blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web.
