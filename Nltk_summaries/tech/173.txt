supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm s prototype blue gene l machine. the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005. its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops and will fit into 64 full racks. but in september ibm said that another blue gene l machine clocked up 36.01 teraflops marginally surpassing the earth simulator s performance. the current top machine japan s nec earth simulator clocks up 35.86. due next week the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster.
