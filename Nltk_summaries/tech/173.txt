the current top machine, japan's nec earth simulator, clocks up 35.86. due next week, the top 500 list officially charts the fastest computers in the world. ibm's senior vice president of technology and manufacturing, nick donofrio, believes that by 2006, blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing. until the official list is published, however, blue gene l's position will not be confirmed, and there are expected to be some other new entries. the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one 5th the speed of the full version, due to be completed for the livermore labs in 2005. its peak theoretical performance is expected to be 360 teraflops, and will fit into 64 full racks. since the first supercomputer, the cray 1, was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976, computational speed has leaped 500,000 times.
