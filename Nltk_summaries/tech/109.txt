according to the study, more than 45 million people in the uk, germany, us and south korea now only use a mobile. it showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. in the us and germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. in all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. in the uk 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality.
