microsoft takes on desktop search microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e mails and other files on a pc hard drive. our ambition for search is to provide the ultimate information tool that can find anything you're looking for, said yusuf mehdi, corporate vice president at microsoft's msn internet division. search giant google launched its desktop search tool in october, while yahoo is planning to release similar software in january. small firms such as blinkx, copernic, enfish x1 technologies and x friend offer tools that catalogue the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer. the beta program only works on pcs running windows xp or windows 2000. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files.
