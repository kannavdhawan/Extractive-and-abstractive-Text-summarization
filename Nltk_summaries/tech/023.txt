in this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task, said mr r. sridharan, vice president of networks at tata. the laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said mr sridharan. in some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours, he said. by contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. the laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps 2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection but tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1 2mbps.
