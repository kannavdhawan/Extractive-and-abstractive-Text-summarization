after the latest round of cuts, there were 80 workers at argonaut headquarters in edgware in north london, with 17 at its morpheme offices in kentish town, london, and 22 at the just add monsters base in cambridge. argonaut founder rebuilds empire jez san, the man behind the argonaut games group which went into administration a week ago, has bought back most of the company. but, like all software developers, argonaut needed a constant flow of deals with publishers. the group's three subsidiaries were placed in administration a week ago, with mr sans resigning as the company's ceo and some 100 staff being fired. this is a very difficult time for all the employees there, but i salute their commitment to the business while we work towards a solution, he said.
