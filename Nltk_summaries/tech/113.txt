it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver, from tv producer illuminations television limited, which is also involved in the project. new media for a new millennium nm2 will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles, explained dr doug williams of bt, who will be nm2's technical project manager. the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story. it will allow viewers to create a so called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense, he said.
