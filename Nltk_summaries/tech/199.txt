i come from a village, says prof reddy, i know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns. prassana rambathla, one of prof reddy's graduate students, says that when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth. ' after all, he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead, prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market. so it's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice. we're doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason. the underlying problem, he says, is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.
