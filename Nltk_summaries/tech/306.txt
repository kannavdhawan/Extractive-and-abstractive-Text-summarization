at the end of last year, chris deering, sony's european president, made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008. a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about 2,000 if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. probably, in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this tv can do', until hd is really adopted by broadcasters, explains dr tuffy.
