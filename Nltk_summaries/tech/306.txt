at the end of last year, chris deering, sony's european president, made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008. a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology about 2,000 if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. probably, in the uk gaming is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this tv can do', until hd is really adopted by broadcasters, explains dr tuffy. the next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high resolution pictures. you are literally going to get to the point, with a lord of the rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the cgi stuff from the dvd. satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010. until broadcast rights, format standards and the practicalities of updating equipment are agreed, tv content will be limited. higher capacity storage discs, such as hd dvd and blue ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.
