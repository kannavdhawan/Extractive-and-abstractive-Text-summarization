currently, tv like services, where clips are downloaded, are offered by several european operators, like italy's tim and 3. mobile tv will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report. more powerful smartphones like the xda ii, nokia 6600, sonyericsson p900 and the orange e200, offering web access, text and multimedia messaging, e mail, calendar and gaming are becoming increasingly common. batteries already have to cope with other services that operators offer, like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras and games amongst others. mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the pc music experience as the handsets are not yet ready, said thomas husson, mobile analyst at jupiter research. despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said jupiter. digital video recorders, like europe's sky box, and video on demand services mean people have much more control over what tv they watch.
