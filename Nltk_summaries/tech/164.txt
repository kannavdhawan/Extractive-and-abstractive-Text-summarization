whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. but, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. companies like securewave, for example, can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual's personal memory card.
