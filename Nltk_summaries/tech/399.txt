after all how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu s ministerial councils as seems likely it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. much of the really useful software we use every day programs like the apache web server the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. if it gets its way the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. be careful how you code a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson. the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents.
