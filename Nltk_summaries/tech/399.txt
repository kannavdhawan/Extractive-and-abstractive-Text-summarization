after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements.
