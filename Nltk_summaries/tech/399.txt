after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention yet if the new directive is nodded through at the next meeting of one of the eu's ministerial councils, as seems likely, it will allow programs to be patented in europe just as they are in the us. much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements. many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement. sadly for those who will be directly affected, the controversy concerns the patenting of computer programs, a topic that may excite the bloggers, campaigning groups and technical press but does not obsess middle britain. if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them. if coders are treated like this today, who is to say that it will not be you tomorrow more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent.
