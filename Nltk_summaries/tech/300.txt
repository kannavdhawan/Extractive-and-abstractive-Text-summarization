apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at, said mr fogg, who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction. the pc world is a pile em high, sell em cheap market, he said, and all of them are pretty interchangeable. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said mr fogg. i think fundamentally it's a good idea because it's cheap even for a pc, said nick ross, deputy labs editor at pc pro. for consumers interested in style, design and small size which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in it's a natural next step, said mr fogg.
