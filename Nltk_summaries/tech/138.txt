firefox browser takes on microsoft microsoft s internet explorer has a serious rival in the long awaited firefox 1.0 web browser which has just been released. the release of firefox 1.0 on 9 november might even cause a few heads to turn at microsoft because the program is steadily winning people away from the software giant s internet explorer browser. firefox has been created by the mozilla foundation which was started by former browser maker netscape back in 1998. much of the development work done since then has gone into firefox which made its first appearance under this name in february. internet monitoring firm websidestory has charted the growing population of people using the firefox browser and says it is responsible for slowly eroding the stranglehold of ie. the mozilla foundation claims that firefox has been downloaded almost eight million times and has publicly said it would be happy to garner 10 of the windows using net browsing population.
