phoenix torrents, another popular bittorrent site, has also decided to shut down and, though it gave no reasons for the closure, it is thought to be motivated by the threat of legal action. last week finnish police raided a bittorrent site based in the country that, according to reports, let 10,000 users shared pirated films, software, music and games. because of the way that bittorrent works, server sites do not host the actual file being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have it. the only parts that would keep going, said the operators of the suprnova site, were the discussion forums and net chat channels. if the site did return, the message said, it would not be hosting any more torrent links.
