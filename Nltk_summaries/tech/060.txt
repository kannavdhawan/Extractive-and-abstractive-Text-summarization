stephen toulouse, a microsoft security manager, said the flaws were known about, and although the firm had not seen any attacks exploiting the flaw, he did not rule them out. many of the flaws could be used by virus writers to take over computers remotely, install programs, change, and delete or see data. if not updated, either automatically or manually, pc users running the programs could be vulnerable to viruses or other malicious attacks designed to exploit the holes. often, when a critical flaw is announced, spates of viruses follow because home users and businesses leave the flaw unpatched. in its monthly security bulletin, it flagged up eight critical security holes which could leave pcs open to attack if left unpatched. they affect windows programs, including internet explorer ie , media player and instant messaging.
