but experts agree that the phenomenon, allowing individuals to publish, share ideas, exchange information, comment on current issues, post images or video on the web easily, is here to stay. andrew nachison, director of the media center, a us based think tank that studies media, technology and society, highlights the us presidential race as a possible turning point for blogs. blog analysis firm technorati estimates the number of blogs in existence, the so called blogosphere, has already exceeded five million, and is growing at exponential levels. others, like the french newspaper le monde, have applied a different strategy, offering blogs as part of its content. these online diaries come in many shapes and styles, ranging from people willing to sharing their views, pictures and links, to companies interested in another way of reaching their customers. the most well known examples include iraqi salam pax's accounts of the us led war, former iranian vice president mohammad ali abtahi exclusive insight into the islamic republic's government, and the highs and lows of the recent us election campaign.
