mike prettejohn, president of netcraft, speculated that the blocking decision might have been taken to cut costs, and traffic, in the run up to the election on 2 november. on 21 october, the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages, videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re election site of president george w bush. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london, amsterdam and sydney failed. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. the blocking does not appear to be due to an attack by vandals or malicious hackers, but as a result of a policy decision by the bush camp.
