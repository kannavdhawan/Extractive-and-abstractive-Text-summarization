bush website blocked outside us surfers outside the us have been unable to visit the official re election site of president george w bush. on 21 october the george w bush website began using the services of a company called akamai to ensure that the pages videos and other content on its site reaches visitors. netcraft said that since the early hours of 25 october attempts to view the site through its monitoring stations in london amsterdam and sydney failed. since then people outside the us trying to browse the site get a message saying they are not authorised to view it. by contrast netcraft s four monitoring stations in the us managed to view the site with no problems.
