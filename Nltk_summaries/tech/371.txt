the conseil superieur de l'audiovisuel csa , the french broadcasting regulator, said following the recent success of freeview in the uk, some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects . a couple of years ago, dtt had a bad image, said olivier gerolami, chief operating officer of tnt. tnt expects between 700,000 and one million dtt set top boxes to be sold in 2005. it is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off, said mr gerolami, but we're optimistic that it will revolutionise television in france. we think free dtt could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay tv in france, said henri de bodinat, vice president of the arthur d. little consultancy. france is the poorest market in europe in terms of free to air national channels, so it has the potential to be one of the biggest dtt markets, mr gerolami added in remarks quoted by the us entertainment industry paper variety. despite the long wait for a french dtt roll out, the new platform's backers hope to emulate the success of its uk free to air counterpart, freeview.
