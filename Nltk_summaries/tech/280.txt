while sky will remain the dominant force in uk pay tv for some time to come, ntl and telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of vod enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into sky's lead, he said. movies from sony pictures, walt disney, touchstone, miramax, columbia and buena vista will be among those on offer. the service is similar to sky plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box yet. in addition, ntl is offering children's programmes, adult content, music video and concerts. there will be less compromising around the tv schedule and some of the less popular channels may go by the wayside, said philip snalune, director of products at telewest. its pick of the week service will offer a selection of bbc programmes from the previous seven days such as eastenders, casualty, top gear and antiques roadshow.
