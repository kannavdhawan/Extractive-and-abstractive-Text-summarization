mr molyneux has been behind many of the ground breaking games of the last 15 years such as populous, theme park, dungeon keeper and black and white. he said he was surprised as much because, not too long ago, many people thought computer gaming was a fad. it was thought to be like skateboarding, he said, a craze that everyone thought would go away. it's come completely out of the blue, he said, i never would have guessed that i'd have that kind of honour. i thought everyone would treat populous as weird, he said, but it became a huge international success. now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence.
