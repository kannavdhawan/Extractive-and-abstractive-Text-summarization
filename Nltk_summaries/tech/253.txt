the key new technologies applied in the world s fastest elevators include a pressure control system which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers preventing ear popping an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft the certification of our elevators as world record holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us said masayuki shimono president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world s fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955. as such it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition when the record was 426m per minute or 25.6 km h less than half the speed of the new record said hein le roux specialist researcher at the guinness world records. fast lifts rise into record books two high speed lifts at the world s tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet s fastest. the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei taiwan. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.
