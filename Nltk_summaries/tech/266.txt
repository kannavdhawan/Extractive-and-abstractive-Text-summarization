its sharp graphics and novel gameplay, with the main character able to pause, slow, rewind and fast forward time, were meant to lure many fans to the new machine. but the game's excellent graphics, easily the best looking platform game around, sound and dollops of humour make it an attractive game for younger platform fans. as in the original, your feline persona can control time, but this time the pigs get to control space. as the game progresses you swap between the two rival factions, pig and feline, assuming the role of your created characters. there are a number of puzzles which require control over time to solve while the pigs can create things such as warps, space bubbles and void traps in order to progress.
