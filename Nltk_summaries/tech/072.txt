the us consumer electronics market is set to grow by over 11 in 2005. but more awareness is needed about how and where old gadgets can be recycled as well as how to be more energy efficient said the us environmental protection agency epa . initiatives like this are critical if power adaptors continue to be made and used as they are now consumer electronics and other small appliances will be responsible for more than 40 of electricity used in us homes said the epa. we are increasingly finding companies that not only want to provide neat hi tech devices but also bundle with it a hi tech efficient power supply the epa s andrew fanara said. but at ces the epa also unveiled new guidelines for its latest energy star initiative which targets external power adapters. although there is a focus on developing efficient and improved circuits in the devices themselves the technologies inside rechargers are still outdated and so eat up more energy than is needed to power a gadget.
