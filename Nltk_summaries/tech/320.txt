playstation 3 processor unveiled the cell processor, which will drive sony's playstation 3, will run 10 times faster than current pc chips, its designers have said. while the playstation 3 is likely to be the first mass market product to use cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. sony, ibm and toshiba, who have been working on the cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on monday. if cell is to challenge intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside pcs, which predominantly run using windows. initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new playstation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip.
