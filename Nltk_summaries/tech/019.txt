writing in the journal nature, dr paniccia and colleagues haisheng rong, richard jones, ansheng liu, oded cohen, dani hak and alexander fang show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently, says dr paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy to make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses.
