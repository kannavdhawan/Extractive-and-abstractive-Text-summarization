a norwegian court ruled in 2003 that bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's court of appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway's performing rights society, tono, and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music, who saw it as an important test of principle.
