a norwegian court ruled in 2003 that bruvik would have to pay 100,000 kroner to the music industry, but the country's court of appeal cleared him, saying that the copyright violation occurred when others posted the music. a legal complaint for copyright violation was filed by groups including norway's performing rights society, tono, and the norwegian branches of sony music and universal music, who saw it as an important test of principle. however, the supreme court stated that the music was clearly published in violation of copyright law it added that the case was decided based on the responsibility for abetting an illegal act, and that bruvik's actions were premeditated. bruvik's site was online between august and november 2001, and while it did not host any music, at its peak it was providing links to more than 170 free files on other servers. norway's music industry said it was satisfied with the ruling, because showed that music piracy would not be accepted. the suits, brought on behalf of the major record companies, cite the individuals for illegally distributing music via unauthorized peer to peer services such as kazaa and edonkey.
