the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky, bagle and mydoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated. in particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e mail messages it was catching. by contrast, said mr hogan, the code for viruses such as gaobot, spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. thanks to these bot nets , spam continued to be a problem in 2004. anti spam firms report that, in many cases, legitimate e mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast spreading virus, said kevin hogan, senior manager in symantec's security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said mr hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs.
